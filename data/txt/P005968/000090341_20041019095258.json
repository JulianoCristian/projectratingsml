The\n            lessons learned indicate that an implementing agency must be\n            accountable to some form of governing body and have a clear\n            and transparent organizational structure. Local institutions\n            need to play major role in the decision-making process and\n            in implementing relevant mitigatory measures. Environmental\n            management plans, and more importantly resettlement plans,\n            need to be considered an investment priority and implemented\n            in coordination with the construction phase of the main\n            civil works in order to mitigate potential future conflicts.\n            The complexity and management commitment required to manage\n            Involuntary Resettlement is often underestimated.\n            Environmental management and resettlement/rehabilitation\n            plans should be immediately updated when unforeseen delays\n            and situations arise. Siting of hydroelectric dams is the\n            single most important decision shaping environmental and\n            social issues. A good communications program is critical.\n            Due to a lack of sufficient baseline information, Yacyreta\n            Binational Entity (EBY) has repeatedly been unable to\n            respond properly to claims as they arise, which has resulted\n            in increased social conflicts. Land acquisition and\n            resettlement must be linked. Phased resettlement, in\n            addition to adding costs, also incurs greater social disruption."}, "docdt": "2004-10-15T00:00:00Z"}
