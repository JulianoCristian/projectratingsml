The Request was\n            submitted by Federacion de Afectados por Yacyreta de Itapua\n            y Misiones (FEDAYIM), a local nongovernmental organization\n            on its behalf as well as of more than 4,000 families who\n            believe their lives are being affected socially and\n            environmentally, because of the impacts of the Yacyreta\n            Hydroelectric Dam. According to the Request, these families\n            were not appropriately identified and \"quantified in\n            their real dimensions\" as a consequence, thousands of\n            them were excluded from existing compensation and mitigation\n            programs in spite of the fact that they have owned and\n            occupied lands affected by the construction of the dam for\n            more than 20 years. The Eligibility Report examines the\n            Request and the Management's Response and finds that\n            the Requesters have a righteous claim that the Bank is in\n            violation of its policies and procedures.
