linked to Loans 3520-AR and 3842-PA and subsequently\n            conducted a full Inspection o f the Project.  On May 6, 2004\n            the Board Executive Directors discussed and approved the\n            Management Response to the Inspection Panel's in-depth\n            study.' The Board also asked for follow-up reporting. A\n            90-day Progress Report was issued on August 6, 2004. The\n            Management Response and Recommendation also envisaged\n            subsequent annual reports. This report constitutes the first\n            such annual report and covers the period August 2004 -mid-\n            September 2005. This report includes updates in the\n            following areas: (a) implementation o f the Bank's\n            Action Plan and additional measures identified by Management\n            with respect to the affected parties (including the 2,416\n            families already relocated and the estimated 6,000 families\n            to be relocated in Paraguay prior to completion o f the\n            Project); (b) grievance procedures for resolving claims\n            related to the Project; (c) the activities o f the\n            Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in the Project, and\n            how the IDB and the Bank have been collaborating on issues\n            identified during the Inspection; and (d) decisions taken\n            with respect to the reservoir's water level and\n            potential impacts. Annex 1 provides a datasheet on the\n            Project; and Annex 2 provides a more detailed presentation o\n            f implementation progress on the key issues covered in the\n            Management Action Plan."}, "docdt": "2005-10-25T00:00:00Z"}
