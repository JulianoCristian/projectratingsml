                                   About The Panel
The Inspection Panel was created in September 1993 by the Board of Executive Directors of
the World Bank to serve as an independent mechanism to ensure accountability in Bank
operations with respect to its policies and procedures. The Inspection Panel is an instrument
for groups of two or more private citizens who believe that they or their interests have been
or could be harmed by Bank-financed activities to present their concerns through a Request
for Inspection. In short, the Panel provides a link between the Bank and the people who are
likely to be affected by the projects it finances.


Members of the Panel are selected "on the basis of their ability to deal thoroughly and fairly
with the request brought to them, their integrity and their independence from the Bank's
Management, and their exposure to developmental issues and to living conditions in
developing countries."1 The three-member Panel is empowered, subject to Board approval,
to investigate problems that are alleged to have arisen as a result of the Bank having
ignored its own operating policies and procedures.

                                 Processing Requests

After the Panel receives a Request for Inspection it is processed as follows:

· The Panel decides whether the Request is prima facie not barred from Panel
    consideration.
· The Panel registers the Request--a purely administrative procedure.
· The Panel sends the Request to Bank Management, which has 21 working days to
    respond to the allegations of the Requesters.
· The Panel then conducts a short 21 working-day assessment to determine the eligibility
    of the Requesters and the Request.
· If the Panel does not recommend an investigation, and the Board of Executive Directors
    accepts that recommendation, the case is considered closed. The Board, however, may
    approve an investigation against the Panel's recommendation if it so warrants.
· Three days after the Board decides on whether or not an investigation should be carried
    out, the Panel's Report (including the Request for Inspection and Management's
    Response) is publicly available at the Bank's Info Shop and the respective Bank
    Country Office.
· If the Panel recommends an investigation, and the Board approves it, the Panel
    undertakes a full investigation, which is not time-bound.

                                                                                             i

· When the Panel completes an investigation, it sends its findings and conclusions on the
  matters alleged in the Request for Inspection to the Board as well as to Bank
  Management.
· The Bank Management then has six weeks to submit its recommendations to the Board
  on what actions the Bank would take in response to the Panel's findings and
  conclusions.
· The Board then takes the final decision on what should be done based on the Panel's
  findings and the Bank Management's recommendations.
· Three days after the Board's decision, the Panel's Report and Management's
  Recommendation are publicly available through the Bank's Info Shop and the
  respective Country Office.

                              EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

                                      Introduction

On May 17, 2002, the Inspection Panel received a Request for Inspection from
communities in Paraguay alleging that the Bank had violated its own policies and
procedures in relation to the design and implementation of the Yacyretá Hydroelectric
Project in Argentina and Paraguay.

The Federación de Afectados por Yacyretá de Itapúa y Misiones (FEDAYIM), a
Paraguayan non-governmental organization, submitted the Request on behalf of more
than 4,000 families who believe their lives and environment to be seriously harmed by
the Project Six coordinators of affected people in the San Cosme y Damián, Distrito
Cambyreta, Barrio Pacu Cúa, Barrio Santa Rosa Mboy Caé, Arroyo Potiy, and Barrio
Santa Rosa areas of Paraguay also signed the Request.

The Requesters claim that the raising of the Yacyretá power plant's reservoir to 76 meters
above sea level (masl) has had severe environmental impacts, such as constant flooding
of urban creeks, a higher water table, and the spreading of disease, which has forced them
to live in unbearable conditions. They allege that the proposed wastewater treatment
plant, to be built under the Project, would further pollute the environment because its
location and design are based on a defective environmental assessment and are in
violation of national environmental laws. According to the Requesters, the resettlement
and compensation programs are not being properly implemented. Families affected by
the raising of the reservoir have not been properly identified. The resettlement and
compensation program has left hundreds of affected families and businesses with no or
inadequate compensation, poor resettlement housing and facilities, and prolonged
economic hardship. The Requesters allege that employees of brick and ceramic factories
have not been compensated for their loss of income.

The Inspection Panel registered the Request and, after receiving Management's Response
to the Request and visiting the affected area, recommended to the Board of Executive
Directors that an Inspection be conducted. The Board approved this on September 9,
2002.

The Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project is a joint venture between Argentina and Paraguay,
which was in the planning stages many years before the Bank entered into its first loan
agreement for the Project in 1979.        In 1973, Argentina and Paraguay had already
concluded a treaty for the Yacyretá Hydroelectric Dam, which set forth the terms of the
joint undertaking and created a semi-autonomous bi-national entity, the Entidad
Binacional Yacyretá (EBY), to implement the Project. The treaty granted EBY full
juridical, financial and administrative capacity and assigned it the technical responsibility
to study, plan, direct and execute the hydroelectric Project.




                                                                                           ix

The Project's civil works consist of two 40 meters (m) high, five kilometers (km) long,
concrete dams and 65 km of embankment dam. The works also include a 1.2 km long
powerhouse containing 20 turbines, spillways and a navigation lock. The dam was
designed to be maintained at a level of 83 meters above mean sea level (masl). At this
height the reservoir is estimated to cover an area of about 1650 km2 and inundate about
1,500 hectares (ha) of cultivated land and 500 ha of urban land in cities and towns. When
the first Bank loan was made in 1979, it was anticipated that the inundation at the design
level of 83masl would cause the involuntary resettlement of about 33,000 persons, mostly
from the cities of Posadas and Encarnación. This number has increased very significantly
over the years. By 1992, when the second Bank was made, the number had increased to
42,000. There has been a steady influx of people into the Project area.

Dam construction began in December 1983. By 1992, most civil works were complete.
However, only about half of the resettlement and environmental activities had been
completed. Because of persistent difficulties in obtaining the financing necessary to
complete the project, Argentina and Paraguay sought further loans from the Bank. As a
condition of the Bank loans the two countries agreed to a phased filling of the reservoir
(Cronograma de obras) so as to allow the power plant to start operation. In 1994, the
reservoir was filled to 76 masl, but filling of the reservoir to a higher level was subject to
Bank approval, which was subject to the countries meeting their resettlement and
environmental obligations. As of February 2004, the reservoir remained at 76 masl, and
consequently the power plant was generating energy at only 60% of its capacity.

In 1996 the Panel received its first Request for Inspection concerning the Yacyretá
Hydroelectric Project, which alleged that many activities that should have been
completed prior to filling the reservoir were still pending. In February 1997, at the Board
meeting held to discuss the Panel's recommendation to investigate the 1996 Request,
Management presented two Action Plans (Plan A and Plan B) to address the Project's
outstanding problems. Plan A provided for the completion of the resettlement and
environmental actions that should have been, but were not, implemented before raising
the reservoir's water level to 76 masl. Plan B aimed at dealing with several problems
arising from the reservoir level being held at 76 masl.

Consequently, the Board did not approve the Panel's recommendation to carry out an
investigation. Instead it requested that the Panel assess the proposed Action Plans and
undertake a review of the existing Project's resettlement and environmental problems.
The Panel issued its report on these matters on September 16, 1997.

The Yacyretá Project extends more than two decades and hence has had several sources
of Bank financing. The social and environmental parts of the project are partly financed
under the Argentina-SEGBA V Power Distribution Project (Loan 2854-AR) and the
Paraguay-Reform Project for the Water and Telecommunications Sector (Loan 3842-PA).
The World Bank also provided financial support for Yacyretá under three additional
loans, closed at the time of the 2002 Request to the Panel: Loan 1761-AR financing the
Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project, Loan 2998-AR financing the Electric Sector Power

Project and Loan 3520-AR financing the so-called Second Yacyretá Hydroelectric
Project.

This report concludes the Panel's investigation into the matters alleged in the Request for
Inspection submitted to the Panel in May 2002. The current Panel's chairperson, Ms.
Edith Brown Weiss, led the investigation. Three expert consultants on environmental,
hydrological and social issues assisted the Panel in its undertaking.

This report examines the merits of the claims presented in the Request. It also considers
Management's response to the claims. During its investigation the Panel interviewed
Bank staff in Washington, D.C., visited the project area on four occasions, met with the
Requesters and other project affected people throughout the area, and met with local and
national authorities in both Argentina and Paraguay as well as with EBY officials. The
Panel also identified and carefully reviewed relevant project documents that the
Requesters, Bank staff, Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) staff, EBY officials
and other sources provided to the Panel.

Applicable Bank Policies and Procedures

The Panel finds that the following policies and procedures are relevant to the Request:

        Environmental Assessment OD 4.01 (October 1991)
        Involuntary Resettlement OD 4.30 (June 1990)
        Project Supervision OD/OP/BP 13.05 (March 1989 and July 2001)
        Monitoring and Evaluation OD 10.70 (November 1989)


The Second Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project, was financed by Loan 3520-AR, which was
approved in 1992. This loan is thus subject to the Bank policies relating to Environmental
Assessment, OD 4.01, to Involuntary Resettlement, OD 4.30, and to Project Supervision,
OD/OP/BP 13.05 and to Monitoring and Evaluation, OD 10.70.            Before the loan was
approved, the Bank requested the preparation of an Environmental Assessment as part of
the conditionality for the loan. The resettlement plan that the Borrower prepared and the
Bank reviewed in 1992 remains the operative plan for resettlement.

In 1995, the Bank approved the Asunción Sewerage Project, Loan 3842-PA, which was
later renamed the Reform Project for the Water and Telecommunications Sector. The
resettlement component of the Yacyretá Project financed by this loan is also subject to
the above Bank policies and procedures.

The SEGBA V project, financed under Loan 2854-AR, was initiated before the Bank's
safeguard policies came into force. However, the policies were in effect in 1994 and
1997 when the Loan was changed to allow funds to be applied to the resettlement
components of the Yacyretá Project. The Environmental Assessment and Involuntary
Resettlement policies thus apply to the resettlement activities of the Yacyretá project
funded by Loan 2854-AR.



                                                                                         xi

In addition to the above sources of Bank financing, the IDB has approved loans for the
Yacyretá Project. The Project is thus also subject to the IDB policies and procedures.

                           Environmental Compliance

The Panel addresses the following Bank environmental compliance issues raised by the
Requesters complaint: the adequacy of environmental assessments, the relationship
between the level of the reservoir and urban creek flooding and ground water levels, the
water-related health problems, and the location and design of the sewage treatment plant.

                              Environmental Assessment.

The environmental safeguard policies of OD4.01 require environmental screening and
proper environmental assessment

Environmental Screening

The Bank assigned the Second Yacyretá Project and the Asunción Sewerage Project
(later renamed the Reform Project for the Water and Telecommunications Sectors) to
category A, under OD 4.01. Category A projects         require a full environmental impact
assessment. The Panel finds that the environmental screening process for phase two
of the Yacyretá Project and for the Asunción Sewerage Project was appropriate.

Preparation of Environmental Assessments

Before bringing the Second Yacyretá Project to the Board for approval in 1992, the Bank
had a full environmental assessment prepared. An Environmental Management Plan
(PMMA or EMP) as well as an Action Plan for Resettlement and Rehabilitation (PARR
or RRAP) accompanied the assessment. The Panel finds that the Bank thus met the
requirement of OD 4.01 at that time.

OD 4.01 requires that environmental assessments be prepared for the resettlement
activities financed by the Bank. During most of its investigation, it appeared to the
Panel that Management had not provided for the preparation of these
environmental assessments. However, in November 2003 Management provided to
the Panel environmental assessments that were prepared by EBY consultants as
evidence that the proper environmental assessments had been undertaken. The
Assessments relate to the resettlement sites of Itá Paso, Arroyo Porá, and Carmen del
Paraná, and include a General Summary of a Resettlement and Rehabilitation Action Plan
conducted in terms of the Urban Creeks Program.            The Panel has reviewed the
Assessments and finds that they are very inadequate. They do not comply with the
requirements of OD 4.01. The range of environmental matters addressed is limited;
alternative resettlement sites are not considered; few mitigation measures are
suggested, and affected parties were not consulted. The safeguard envisioned to be
in place through OD 4.01 has therefore failed.



                                                                                       xii

Consideration of Alternatives

OD 4.01 requires that an Environmental Assessment analyze alternatives to those
proposed in the project.

The EA for the Second Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project contains a section titled "Analysis
of Alternatives." The Assessment analyzes alternative operational levels of the dam and
the Aguapey barrage and the likely consequences of implementing the Yacyretá project.
Given the history of the project before the Bank become involved, the Assessment
understandably does not examine the full suite of possible project alternatives, such as the
siting of the dam, but it does realistically consider alternatives for other aspects of the
project.   With respect to the consideration of alternatives the Environmental
Assessment for the Second Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project is in compliance with OD
4.01.

Consideration of the Biophysical Environment

Consistent with OD 4.01, the Environmental Assessment discussed a number of
biophysical parameters. The Panel observes that the biophysical environment
affected by the Yacyretá dam and reservoir is being managed competently and that
the initial environmental problems that arose when the reservoir was first filled
have been satisfactorily resolved.

The Panel finds that the future environmental management of the Yacyretá Project
is critically threatened, however, by the Project's financial position and that both
the natural environment and project-affected people will suffer additional harm if
the project's environmental management practices deteriorate.

Consideration of Urban and Peri-urban Environments

The Panel finds that the EA for the Second Yacyretá Project was inadequate in
several respects in its consideration of urban and peri-urban environments. The EA
did not adequately consider the effects of population growth on Encarnación, or the
effects of the resettlement developments on     the city's infrastructure. The Panel finds
that the safeguards to assess the implications for water supply, sewers, and urban
drainage, which ought to have been in place via OD 4.01, were by-passed. Thus,
Management is not in compliance with the requirements of OD 4.01.

More generally, the Panel finds that Management's failure to assess the impact of
the resettlement sites on the overall urban system is not in compliance with OD 4.30
as well as OD 4.01.       The Panel notes, however, that in the context of the PDA,
Management has advised EBY to co-ordinate resettlement in urban development plans.




                                                                                        xiii

OD 4.01 calls for an EA to consider the environmental effects of "induced
development." This includes effects on villages above the level of flooding associated
with movements of population, including effects on their economies and livelihoods of
their people. The Panel finds that environmental and social assessments should have
anticipated the induced effects associated with the Yacyretá Project.

       Implications of Non-compliance with Environmental Safeguard Policies

In part as a consequence of the Bank's failure to observe its safeguard policy on
environmental assessment, affected persons are dissatisfied with the Bank's resettlement
schemes, the resettlement schemes have given rise to problems of storm-water run-off
and overloading of sewerage lines, and the limited resources of the local municipal
authorities are being taxed.      This is a situation which neither Bank staff, project
proponents, or affected persons desire or with which they are satisfied. This Project
demonstrates that taking short-cuts with the Bank's safeguard policies is
counterproductive for all concerned.

                                Flooding of Urban Creeks

The Panel finds that the construction of the Yacyretá dam has a negligible effect on
the water level of the Paraná river at Encarnación, especially in times of flood.

The Panel also finds that the Yacyretá reservoir is frequently operated under
conditions that produce a water level in excess of 76 masl at Encarnación and that
this is not consistent with both the loan agreement and the Third Owners
Agreement, as amended.

The Panel found that Management has accepted an error in the calculation of water
level at Encarnación. From its analysis the Panel finds that the contention of
affected persons that the Yacyretá reservoir is frequently operated under conditions
that produce a water level in excess of 76 masl at Encarnación is correct. The
excess, however, is limited to one meter or less.

Although it is clear that the urban creeks of Encarnación are flooding and causing
severe hardship, the Panel finds that the Requesters contention that this flooding is
a consequence of the Yacyretá reservoir itself cannot be sustained. The hydrological
assessments show that neither the Paraná River floods nor backwater in the M'boi Caé is
sufficient to cause the levels of flooding experienced in the urban creeks.

The urban creek flood conditions are mainly due to local conditions, such as
upstream urbanization, lack of urban storm water drainage, and waste
accumulation impeding water flow in the creeks, in that order. The contribution of
specific resettlement areas to flood peak downstream is estimated as low. But the
sum of all urbanization done upstream during the last years has increased the
frequency and the peak level of the floods.




                                                                                    xiv

                     Environmental Pollution and Water Quality

The Panel confirms the Requesters contention that flooding of the urban creeks
makes the drinking water wells on the flood plain unsuitable for use. However, the
Panel finds that the alleged causal relationship between the level of the Yacyretá
reservoir and pollution of wells and flooding of latrines is not correct.

With respect to the claim that the Yacyretá reservoir has caused environmental pollution,
the Panel finds that Bank Management has ensured that proper monitoring of water
quality has been conducted in the reservoir. Water quality monitoring has been an
ongoing activity since before the filling of the Yacyretá reservoir. The Panel verified
the existence of the water quality monitoring data and the reasonableness of
Management's claim that "the reservoir's water quality is constantly monitored,
[and] falls within satisfactory parameters."

                                    Health Problems

The Requesters allege that the reservoir has caused severe health problems. In response
Management refers to the disease monitoring program undertaken by the Ministry of
Health and Social Welfare of Paraguay. The bimonthly reports provided by this Ministry
indicate no per capita increase in the diseases that have been monitored since the filling
of the reservoir. The Panel verified the existence of the monitoring program,
reviewed its findings, and found no evidence contradicting the findings.

A frequent complaint to the Panel during site visits was that women suffer constantly
from itchy skin, particularly on their hands and arms. This is attributed to the use of
polluted water for washing clothes. The Panel notes that the Yacyretá reservoir is not
the cause of the polluted water used by the complainants for washing clothes and that
there are potentially many different reasons why such skin irritations might occur.

The Panel notes that it is not disputed that disease vectors are present in the Paraná river
system. The question is whether there has been an increase in their abundance since the
Yacyretá reservoir was created. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Paraguay
has a long-term ongoing study that shows no increase in abundance or species
composition of disease vectors. The Panel verified the existence and findings of this
study and found no evidence to the contrary.

The Panel confirmed that the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Paraguay
adequately monitors the incidence of both disease and disease vectors.

                              Wastewater Treatment Plant

The conditions for sewage discharge in Encarnación have been very poor for many years,
with numerous discharges of wastewater directly into creeks and other water bodies.
The Bank has required that a sewerage treatment system be provided for
Encarnación before the reservoir is raised above 76 masl. The first step required



                                                                                         xv

under Bank policy is a proper environmental assessment of the proposed wastewater
treatment plant.

While the Requesters are opposed to the location selected for the planned wastewater
treatment plant, the Panel finds that the site selected is not inappropriate for the
purpose and that the environmental assessment for the wastewater treatment plant
is not defective either procedurally or substantively.

The Panel finds that the environmental assessment of the design for the wastewater
treatment plant complies with OD 4.01. The Panel notes its great concern, however,
that although the sewerage system has been designed to cover the city of
Encarnación, the works described in current bidding documents seem to cover only
the southern part of the city (zona sur).

The Requesters claimed that the sewerage system will not cover some of the
resettlement areas. The Panel finds that it is planned that the resettlement areas in
question will be linked to the reticulated sewerage system. The Panel notes,
however, that confusion may have arisen over the coverage of the wastewater
treatment because the detailed drawings of the planned sewerage reticulation
system for Encarnación were not publicly available in the EBY information office.

Importantly, the Panel finds that responsibility for the cost of connection to the
sewer system may become a significant source of conflict in the not too distant
future. If the matter is not resolved in a way that will enable the vast majority of
households to be connected to the sewer lines, the entire exercise of providing a sewer
network will be largely negated. The Panel finds that this issue needs the urgent
attention of Bank Management and that an effective means for financing the
connection of houses to the sewer network is required, especially for poor
communities.

The Panel finds that Management must give urgent attention to the practicalities of
transferring operation and maintenance of the sewage treatment system away from
EBY and to ensuring that the new operators are provided with adequate staff,
budget and training to be able to run the sewage system efficiently and effectively.
This is especially urgent, because the sewage system includes a bypass at each
pumping station that will dump raw sewage into neighboring urban creeks in cases
of pump malfunction or overflow.

                                 Social Compliance

                           Identification of affected people

To identify the families eligible for compensation or resettlement, EBY conducted two
censuses: in 1980 and in 1990. The latter was done in response to population growth and
change.   OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement requires that resettlement plans be based
on recent information about the scale and impact on displaced populations and requires a



                                                                                    xvi

socio-economic survey that records the names of the affected families. The Requesters
claim that thousands of eligible families are not included in the census and thus have
been excluded from the compensation and mitigation programs provided under the
project's resettlement programs. The Panel finds persuasive evidence that a number of
people who were present at the time of the 1990 census were erroneously omitted
and that they fear they will be ineligible for the Project compensation and
resettlement benefits.

Population has increased very substantially since 1990 in the areas to be flooded.   The
Panel finds that before the water level is raised further, the Bank must confirm that
the existing census and survey data will be updated and verified, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of OD 4.30. The survey needs to pay special attention
to the accuracy of the geographical and topographical boundaries of the affected areas to
allow proper identification of the affected people.

The Requesters claim that there are errors in the census information because a person's
eligibility for certain kinds of compensation for lost productive income is partly
determined by the person's "primary occupation" listed in the 1990 census.          This
overlooks those who lost significant income but did not designate the source as a
"primary occupation, " which especially affects brick and tile-makers and fishermen. The
Panel finds that the restoration of income-earning capacity under OD 4.30 may not
be achieved when compensation for income losses is based solely on the "principal
occupation" of the affected persons, because a person could have several
occupations that contribute substantially to their overall personal income. The
Panel is aware, however, of the practical problems of restoring income for more
than one principal occupation.

The Panel finds that the sole reliance in the 1990 census on an individual's principal
occupation as the basis for restoration of income does not satisfy OD 4.30's
requirement for many affected people.

                                  Grievance Procedures

A number of the concerns raised by the Requesters would normally be settled with an
appropriate conflict resolution mechanism provided as part of a resettlement plan. OD
4.30 provides for such a mechanism.

Although the Panel was informed that there were some procedures to rectify any
omissions in the 1990 census, the Panel finds that at best these procedures were ad
hoc arrangements that allowed some corrections to the census. Most people who felt
excluded did not have a clear and objective procedure for bringing their concerns to
EBY. The Panel further finds that procedures for correcting the census or other
resettlement related omissions and errors are inadequate, and notes that a standard
and transparent appeals procedure is not available to affected people. This does not
comply with OD 4.30, paragraph 8 footnote 11 and paragraph 17).




                                                                                     xvii

                          Other Categories of Affected People


The Panel finds evidence that host populations near resettlement sites are, in some
cases, adversely affected by the design and construction of the resettlement sites, or
by added burdens on local infrastructure due to the influx of resettled population.
OD 4.30 and OD 4.01 require that such impacts be assessed and mitigated. The
Panel has already noted its finding that new resettlement construction should have
had adequate environmental and social impact assessments.

The Panel also finds that there was inadequate effort on the part of the Bank to
ensure that the host population was informed and consulted with in planning and
carrying out construction of the resettlement sites, as required by OD 4.30,
paragraph 9.

                            Resettlement and Compensation

To analyze the claim that the Bank has not complied with OD 4.30, the Panel addresses
separately the two major issues: compensation and resettlement. These issues are inter-
related.

Compensation

OD 4.30 expressly requires that displaced persons should be compensated for losses at
full replacement cost and prior to their actual move.

EBY has in the past employed a two-stage process in the valuation of homes and
property: a provisional or estimated appraisal and a final appraisal that should be done at
time of expropriation. The estimated appraisals had no validity as a component of the
final valuation procedure.

The Panel finds that the use of provisional appraisals is not inconsistent with Bank
policies. However, because affected people did not receive adequate information
about the procedure and did not participate in its implementation, there has been
considerable confusion about the purpose and use of the provisional appraisals. OD
4.30 calls for the Bank to monitor the actual appraisal values that will be paid when
these properties are involuntarily expropriated if the water level is raised.

Compensation for Customary Rights to Land and Loss of Access to Other
Resources

Many of the displaced people do not hold title to the land upon which their houses or
resources are located. OD 4.30 requires compensation for both property to which people
hold title and property to which they do not. The 1992 resettlement plan provided for
compensation to all displaced persons, regardless of whether they had title to their



                                                                                      xviii

properties.    The Panel finds this provision in the 1992 resettlement plan is in
compliance with the requirement of OD 4.30 regarding usufruct or customary rights
to land.

The loss of access to natural resources that must be compensated in this Project include
access to clay deposits. The Panel finds that to the extent that the resettlement plan
provides for compensation for loss of access to these resources, the Bank is in
compliance with the requirements of OD 4.30. However, implementation procedures
may have resulted in denying compensation to some affected people.

Compensation Prior to Displacement

OD 4.30 requires that full compensation be paid to displaced people prior to their actual
move. Not all persons flooded out of their property in the 1994 flooding of the
reservoir to the 76 meter level were properly compensated beforehand. In 1997,
Management assisted EBY in developing the so-called "Plan A." The Panel views
Plan A as a remedy for this violation of OD 4.30.

The Panel, however, found many instances after Plan A was in effect, in which people
whose homes were flooded when the water level was raised in 1994, still feel
inadequately compensated. People had either to accept the amount offered by EBY and
in doing so agree to forego any further claim to additional funds, or take the matter to
court. If they took the matter to court, they would have no access to the funds until after
a court decision. Thus, the Panel finds that the grievance procedures in effect during
and since the time when the reservoir was raised to the 76 meter level were not in
compliance with OD 4.30's requirement for fair compensation. The Panel notes,
however, that Paraguay adopted a new law governing expropriations in January 2001.
The Panel finds that the provision of the new law granting access to funds during
appeal is consistent with OD 4.302.

The Sequencing of Places Selected for Compensation

The Requesters have expressed concern that while there are still many "pending debts"
for people who had to move from below the 78 masl level, EBY is picking and choosing
properties between 78 and 84 masl for relocating and compensating owners and that this
is being done in a non-transparent process. The presumption of OD 4.30 is that
compensation and resettlement will happen relatively quickly. When the presumption
that resettlement will happen relatively quickly fails, Bank Management must
ensure, consistent with the purpose of OD 4.30, that there is a rationale for the
sequencing of resettlement and that the sequencing process is transparent and fair.




2There are a number of questionable aspects of the new law on which the Panel does not comment.


                                                                                                xix

                                              Resettlement

Alternative Sites

The Requesters claim that this Project has generally failed to examine adequately a range
of alternative resettlement sites. The Panel finds that Management needed to ensure that
alternative sites were considered in the Environmental Assessment for the resettlement
areas. The failure to consider acceptable resettlement alternatives is not in
compliance with OD 4.30.

Restoration of Income Earning Capacity

The Requesters claim that inadequate programs were developed for the economic and
productive rehabilitation of the affected families. While recognizing that there have
been commendable efforts to develop productive projects, the Panel finds that the
measures for restoring income earning capacity have been inadequate. Some people
were moved far from the market for their products and services, while others have found
transportation to their place of work difficult and costly. Few who lost their livelihood
have been offered adequate training to replace their lost source of income. The Panel
recognizes that a severe economic crisis occurred in the area. However, this does not
negate the importance of restoring income earning capacity through long term measures
rather than temporary fixes.

Resettlement and Compensation of Specific Groups: Brick-makers and Tile-makers
                                              (ceramists)3

The Requesters complain that, while EBY provided compensation for several brick- and
tile-making establishments, it relocated others to areas far away from the clay deposits.
Moreover, when EBY paid compensation to the factories, it benefited only the factory
owners and left a large number of workers without jobs or compensation. The Requesters
urge the Bank to compel EBY to create a program of job retraining for these affected
communities.

OD 4.30 requires that all affected people who lose their sources of income as a result of a
Bank-financed project be compensated for their losses even in cases where they have not
been physically displaced. The Panel notes that, as early as 1997, in the context of its
Review and Assessment of Action Plans of the Yacyretá project, it urged the Bank to
ensure that affected workers who lost their jobs as a result of the raising of the level of
the reservoir be compensated as required by Bank policy.



3The terms "tile -makers", tile and "ceramists" are used in this report interchangeably to refer to the same
type of production unit.


                                                                                                           xx

Small Scale Brick-makers

The Project's Resettlement and Rehabilitation Action Plan (PARR) identified industries
dedicated to brick and tile-making ­ commonly called oleros ­ as among those that
would be affected by the raising of the reservoir.

One compensation option was to provide the oleros private plots which did not contain
clay and to supply them with clay from other sources for five years. This option was
adopted for the San Pedro resettlement site. The Panel found in its visit to the San
Pedro site that while families had reestablished their brick making activities, many
complained about losses in their income level and about lack of continued access to
raw material because the five-year clay supply had ended.

Another compensation option for small artisan brick makers was to receive cash
compensation based on their "production capacity" together with a house and plot. The
Resettlement Plan did not recommend this option, and it was expected that few would opt
for it. However, the number of families who elected cash compensation was substantial.
The option encouraged more people to settle in the area and to begin small brickworks in
the hope of additional cash compensation, since the raising of the water level was
postponed.

Medium and Large-size Industries

The 1992 PARR considered that large-scale industries had the capacity to relocate on
their own, if provided indemnification for the property lost, and thus did not consider
resettlement as an option under the plan. In 1995 EBY approved an alternative
compensation solution for roof-tile industries, the so-called "self relocation" option. If the
establishment chose to self relocate, it would be paid for improvements it had made and
for the cost of a five-year supply of clay in accordance with the establishment's
customary production levels.

The Panel finds that the industry owners could be expected to make an informed
decision as to the value and prospects of their clay deposits and to be able to choose
freely whether to accept the compensation package offered. However, the Panel
expresses concerns about the adequacy of providing only a five year supply of clay, as
this appears to be a temporary mitigation measure rather than a solution that would allow
the activity to continue in the long-term.

Compensation to the Workers of Brick and Tile-making Industries

The Request for Inspection claims that EBY compensated the owners of brick and tile-
making industries, but the workers did not receive any compensation. Management's
Response emphasized that the employer, not EBY, is responsible for compensating its
workers and that industry owners who "were compensated but did not continue




                                                                                          xxi

production had to give workers severance pay" in accordance with the Paraguayan labor
laws.4

To address the Panel's requests for clarifications, Management requested a Paraguayan
law firm, Estudio Mersan Abogados, to prepare a legal review and analysis of
Paraguayan law. The legal opinion concluded that workers (formal and informal) have a
right to severance payment if their contract is rescinded. The payment obligation binds
the employer, not EBY.

The Panel repeatedly requested Bank information on EBY's procedures to compensate
the owners and received conflicting statements from Management and EBY. During the
Panel's visit in December 2003, EBY officials clearly described the reimbursement
procedure. EBY calculates the value of severance payments to the workers based on the
employer's declaration regarding the number and status of employees in the firm. The
owner is to pay the properly registered workers their severance payments, which EBY
subsequently reimburses up to the predetermined amount. Such reimbursement is,
however, conditional on the employer providing evidence that each employee had been
properly registered and social security taxes paid.

Many brick and tile-maker workers who lost their source of income as a consequence of
the Yacyretá project belong to the category of informal workers, for whom employers did
not keep official employment records or pay social security taxes. The Panel finds that
the large number of informal workers who worked in large, mechanized industries
as well as in small-scale brick-making facilities were in practice excluded from the
compensation system that the Bank approved, even though they suffered the
adverse impacts of the project.

Based on the foregoing, the Panel finds that the compensation program approved by
the Bank was not consistent with OD 4.30 because it excluded in practice
compensation for a specific category of economic losses that affected one of the
poorest segments of the area population ­ that is, the informal workers of the brick
and roof-tile industries.

The Panel is very concerned that the Bank approved compensation methods whereby
workers, especially informal workers, must go to court to enforce their rights if their
employer does not follow the law.

The Panel is surprised to read in Management documents provided to the Panel that
"[t]o the extent that we are aware, there has not been a single legally recognized
claim by a terminated employee against his or her employer." Many claims brought
by terminated employees against their employer were brought to the attention of the
Panel on its visits.

                                                                                   xxii

The Panel notes that with respect to the employers, if EBY estimates an inadequate
amount of compensation for the owner's workers, and the workers successfully obtain
higher compensation through the courts, the amount EBY will eventually reimburse the
employer who paid workers will only be the one included in the EBY worksheet.

Access to Clay Deposits

The Panel finds that the Bank-approved provision of five years access to clay has not
fully met OD 4.30's requirement that project-affected people have their pre-
resettlement income earning capacity improved or at least restored. In stating this,
the Panel recognizes that a severe economic crisis has occurred in the area. While
recognizing that there have been efforts to retrain the brick-makers for other
vocations, the Panel finds that for many people their income earning capacity seems
not to have been restored.

                           Adequacy of the Resettlement Plan

The Panel finds that there is a detailed resettlement plan, timetable, and budget for
this project "aimed at improving or at least restoring the economic base for those
relocated," as required by OD 4.30, paragraph 4. Thus, the Bank is in formal
compliance with this requirement of OD 4.30. However, the plan, budget, and
particularly the timetable envisaged within that plan have not worked as originally
intended, creating a compliance issue for other aspects of this OD.

Influx of People into the Project Area

OD 4.30 requires that after the area affected by the project and the displaced population
have been identified, the host government ensure that persons ineligible for compensation
do not come into the identified affected area. In the Yacyretá project, there has been a
large influx of people into the area.

The Panel finds that the resettlement plan as designed could not prevent the influx
of ineligible population, because the legal framework was inadequate for doing so.
This does not comply with OD 4.30 paragraph 12.

Delays and Uncertainties

An issue of broad concern is that there has been an extraordinary amount of uncertainty
and delay due to the long-term postponement in raising the reservoir's water level. These
delays are themselves the source of severe hardship for many people. They do not know
if and when they will be resettled; they are unable to sell or expand their properties; and
in many ways they have to adjust the normal social organization of their households in
order to remain eligible for compensation. This has occurred despite the requirement of
OD 4.30 that any resettlement plan accepted by the Bank be "time bound."




                                                                                      xxiii

The Panel finds that in the complex situation of this project, with its very long
delays in implementation, the Bank should have recognized that its resettlement
plan was potentially not time bound. It should have made adequate allowances in
the 1992 plan and later modifications of it for the extreme hardships that have
occurred as a result of uncertainties and delays in implementing the plan. Where a
person can document a loss directly attributable to the very long delay in
resettlement, such loss should be recognized under OD 4.30, but the Panel
recognizes that in practice this will be very difficult to implement.

         Programa Desborde de Arroyos (PDA) ­ the Urban Creeks Program

The Request raises a number of issues related to the design and implementation of the
Urban Creeks Program (PDA), which provides for resettling families who live in serious
unsanitary conditions along urban creeks in areas between 78 and 84 masl before they
would otherwise be. The Requesters are concerned that the PDA will not benefit those for
whom it was intended and that EBY did not adequately consult the affected people in
preparing the PDA program.

The Panel notes that both Management Response and EBY officials confirm that
alternative sites for relocating these families were not considered in the context of the
PDA program, even as future possibilities. As indicated previously, the Panel finds that
the failure to consider acceptable resettlement alternatives does not comply with OD
4.30. The Panel further finds that the resettlement sites that they were offered did
not ensure access to employment and services comparable to                       their old
neighborhoods.

The Panel also interviewed many people who were extremely confused about the
PDA program, its purpose, who was included and when, and whether they were
supposed to relocate. The Panel finds that under OD 4.30 Management must ensure
that affected people are systematically informed and consulted about their options
and rights during the preparation and implementation of the PDA program.

                       Project Supervision and Monitoring

OD 13.05 states that project supervision is one of the Bank's most important activities.

The Requesters claim that the Bank has violated its policies on project supervision and
project monitoring and evaluation, in particular in the implementation of the resettlement
activities. In the Requesters' view, this meant that the Bank allowed the power plant to
begin its operations before completing, in the first place, the resettlement of the affected
population, leaving thousands of people worse off than before the Project started.

                       Supervision of Environmental Operations

A distinction must be made between the supervision of the environmental aspects of the
main civil works components of the project and that of the resettlement activities. The



                                                                                       xxiv

Bank's participation in the design, execution and supervision of environmental mitigation
activities of the main works was quite successful. The frequent supervision missions were
most of the time adequately staffed and a rather stable team was in charge. A number of
corrective measures were taken to avoid or mitigate harm during project execution. The
Panel therefore finds that the Bank met the requirements of OD 13.05 with regard
to the environmental aspects of the main civil works components of the Project.

                         Supervision of Resettlement Activities

The Request primarily addresses problems related to the location and design of the
resettlement sites, the quality of workmanship, and the lack of consultations with, and
options provided to, those who must be resettled.

After reviewing the evidence presented by Requesters, Management's Response and
the Panel's independent observations, the Panel finds that supervision of
resettlement by the Bank is inadequate in two important respects: a failure to
ensure sound technical quality in the design, construction, and implementation of
resettlement programs, and inadequate consultation with affected people.

Technical Quality Assurance: Standards of Design, Construction, and
Implementation

The Panel found that supervision of the design and construction of infrastructure
for the resettlements associated with the Yacyretá Project, including those financed
under the Paraguay Reform Project for the Water and Telecommunications
Sectors, the SEGBA V project, and the Programa Desborde de Arroyos (PDA) has
been inadequate. Supervision missions appear to have given little attention to
technical quality assurance. This does not comply with paragraph 29 of OD 13.05.

During the Panel's visits, the Panel saw numerous examples of poor quality construction
of houses as well as poor drainage systems, extremely poor road construction leading to
easily lifted cobblestones and major pothole damage even on new roads, with severe
problems caused apparently by storm water drainage. In at least one case, the quality of
site construction was so poor that a new class of affected people around the site has been
created. The Panel finds that if supervision had been stronger, Bank staff would
have spotted the poor quality of construction within resettlement sites.

The Panel finds that there is clear need for more effective supervision of technical
design and construction in all facets of the Yacyretá resettlement scheme and notes
the necessity for adequate supervision of technical design and supervision in
resettlement schemes generally.

After many visits to the area by the Inspection Panel and follow-up interviews with Bank
staff members, the supervision mission of October 2003 noted in its Aide Memoire that
"there is no integration of environmental management into the design and construction of
urban civil works, mostly in the resettlement sites." The Aide Memoire urged a number



                                                                                      xxv

of steps be taken to redress the situation. This contrasts with Management's statements in
its memorandum to the Panel on January 13, 2004 that "Bank oversight has ensured that
EBY's capacity to apply those criteria and procedures [appropriate environmental criteria
and procedures] was sufficient" and that "the Task Team verified the success of their
approach through regular visits to the resettlement locations during supervision." The
memorandum also noted that "[t]he approach used throughout this period has been
consistent with Bank policy and practice toward projects and their sub-projects that have
minimal environmental impacts (such as the Itá Paso and Arroyo Porá resettlement sites,
as well as other minor PDA-associated infrastructure.)"5

The Requesters claim that the resettlements built by the Project at Buena Vista and San
Pedro have aggravated the environmental and health situation by directly discharging into
the creeks. Management Response notes that the solution to this problem is the
construction of the wastewater treatment plant, to which the resettlement sites at Buena
Vista and San Pedro will in due course be connected. The Panel finds that given the
foreseeable delays in the construction of the wastewater treatment plant,
Management should have anticipated the problem of delay and ensured that
appropriate interim arrangements for discharge of the wastes were made until the
plant was built and all house connections made.

The Panel finds that Management's failure to ensure sound technical quality of
work on the resettlement project and to encourage needed design changes as
circumstances change is not in compliance with OD 13.05 on Project Supervision.

Consultation with Affected People

BP 13.05 makes explicit the principle that effective supervision necessarily includes
consultation with project affected people. The Panel is concerned that the Bank's
supervision missions have not interacted meaningfully with affected people or thoroughly
monitored the resettlement sites

The Panel finds that there is a wide discrepancy between the recollections of
affected people in the Project area, who insist there have been no meaningful
consultation or thorough on site visits and the Bank's statements about its
supervision missions. The Panel finds that Management must ensure that it consults
with and interacts meaningfully with affected people and that consultations must be
in settings where affected people feel able to convey effectively their concerns to
Bank staff.    Bank supervision missions should clearly state the places they visited
during field inspections and the conditions under which they visited (e.g. with
Project staff or accompanied by representatives of NGOs, etc.), in order to better
document not only that supervision missions were present in the area, but that the
supervision team members actually had contact with affected persons and
investigated matters directly dealing with issues of social safeguard policies.

                                                                                          xxvi

                                   Level of Supervision

The Panel observes that during field visits to the Project area many people affected by the
project strongly expressed their own perception that corruption pervades the political life
of the Project area and includes those responsible for, and benefiting from, resources
provided by EBY.

The Panel is not in a position to comment on the accuracy of the perception of
corruption. However, under these circumstances, the Panel finds that the Bank
needs to expect a higher than usual level of supervision in order to ensure that
corruption does not occur and to assure affected people that this is so. While a larger
than average number of supervision missions, which included three High Level
Supervision Meetings, demonstrates more intense supervision than is usual, it may not be
an adequate response to alleviate the perceptions and suspicions of project-affected
persons. The supervision missions appear to have been inadequate in meeting directly
with affected persons in appropriate settings, and in focusing on social safeguard issues.
This has contributed to the affected people's apparent hostility towards the Bank staff.

                             Expertise in Bank supervision

The Panel points to the need for Management to ensure that the missions have the
requisite technical expertise to adequately review the design and construction of
urban resettlements and the impact of the resettlement areas on neighboring areas
and to the need to ensure that reviews are conducted in an integrated way.

As the Yacyretá Project proceeded, the resettlement issues became progressively more
important and difficult to address. The Panel notes that Bank supervision of the
Yacyretá Project's resettlement and rehabilitation activities did not adapt
effectively to this change by using more technical and social expertise to address
these problems, as is required to carry out OD 13.05, paragraph 1 (b).

According to the Aide Memoire, there has not been and there is not yet any clear strategy
to counteract the negative perceptions that the population has of the project. The absence
of an effective communication strategy has significantly damaged relations between
those concerned with implementing the project and the affected civilian population.

The Panel notes that the October 2003 supervision mission's conclusions and
recommendations regarding the social aspects of the project, as presented in the
related Aide Memoire, reflect those that Bank policies require. The problem is that
these detailed recommendations were given after 20 years into the project
implementation, rather than before approving the projects' resettlement plan and
related documents. Indeed, they seemed to have come only after the Panel had
completed most of its investigation.




                                                                                      xxvii

    Linkages Between Supervisions Reports (Aide Memoires and Back-to-Office
Reports), Progress Reports to the Board, and Management Response to Request for
                                        Inspection

Given the serious delays in implementing the resettlement programs and the social and
environmental problems associated with resettlement, the Panel inquired into whether the
supervision reports reflected these conditions and whether the Progress reports to the
Board reflected the content of the supervision reports. The Panel is concerned that the
progress reports to the Board are more optimistic than the supervision reports in certain
respects. It is also concerned that Management's response to the Requesters is more
optimistic than the supervision reports.

There are at least three ways in which some of the reports Management prepared for the
Board presented a more optimistic outlook than the Aide Memoires and the
circumstances merited: by continued reference to virtual completion of Plan A, even
though it is still not fully complete; by setting forth dates for the completion of the
resettlement that were too reassuring, and by describing over a number of years the
construction of the waste treatment plant "as soon to be started and completed", even
though construction has yet to begin in 2004.

Based on the foregoing, the Panel finds that Management has in some respects been
too optimistic in informing the Board on the future of project implementation. The
Panel understands that it is difficult to accurately predict when certain aspects of
the project will be completed. It believes some of the reporting has understated
serious difficulties in project implementation. The Panel especially notes that only
after it had conducted its own field research from January through Decembe r 2003
and conducted follow-up staff interviews did Management produce an Aide
Memoire (October 23-30, 2003) that identified many of the problems the Panel had
found and the remedial actions which need to be taken.

                          Factors Affecting Project Completion

The Panel understands that presently Argentina and Paraguay are trying to reach a final
decision on the level of the reservoir. A decision to raise the reservoir to the design level
of 83 masl or to any height between the current 76 masl and the design level will have
significant social, economic, and environmental impacts on many of the Requesters as
well as important financial implications. The taking of a final decision could provide an
end to years of uncertainty regarding when and to what level the reservoir will be filled
and operated.

According to evidence received by the Panel, the Bank maintains its position that the
raising of the reservoir must be preceded by the mitigation and resettlement measures
agreed upon between the Bank, the IDB, the governments of Argentina and Paraguay and
the EBY.     The Panel notes that a number of essential social and environmental
activities have yet to be completed in order to raise the water level beyond the
current 76 masl.       Although up­to-date estimates of the investment cost required to



                                                                                      xxviii

complete these activities are not available, the latest figures in the 2002 Strategic Plan
prepared by EBY show that to raise the reservoir from its present level to 78 masl would
cost about US$282 million. To raise it to 80masl, an additional amount of about US$298
million would be required, and to bring the reservoir to its design level of 83 masl,
US$134 million more would be required. To this US$740million, an amount of about
US$200 million must be added to complete a number of additional investments provided
under the Yacyretá treaty. All of these amounts are expressed in July 2002 prices and
have not been independently verified by the Bank.         EBY is preparing revised cost
estimates that are expected to be lower than those in the 2002 Strategic Plan. Raising the
reservoir to its design level would increase EBY generation capacity substantially but,
given current and projected electricity market demand and prices, EBY's generation of
revenue would be highly unlikely to cover these investments in the foreseeable future.
The financial sources for the required investments have yet to be determined and remain
a major constraint for any decision to raise the reservoir above its present level of
operation.

The Panel finds that the long delays that have already occurred in implementing the
resettlement and environmental mitigation activities have brought substantial costs
and serious hardships to the affected populations. The Panel further notes the
urgent need for a decision to define the final operating level of the reservoir. The
Panel wishes to highlight the economic and social costs associated with any decision
regarding the level of the reservoir if it is not politically or otherwise feasible to
implement the decision fully and in a timely manner. The governments' decisions
as to whether, how much, and when to raise the operating level of the reservoir will
directly affect the ability of the Bank to bring this project into compliance with its
operational policies and procedures.

                               1. REQUEST FOR ANINVESTIGATION

1.1. Request for Inspection Submitted to the Panel

1.       On May 17, 2002, the Panel received a Request for Inspection ("the Request")6
         alleging that the World Bank ("the Bank") violated its own policies and
         procedures in relation to the design and implementation of the Yacyretá7
         Hydroelectric Project ("the Project") situated in Argentina and Paraguay. As
         stated in the Request, this alleged violation resulted in harm to the local people
         and the environment in Paraguay. As described below,8 the Yacyretá
         Hydroelectric Project has been partly financed by several Bank loans, including
         the Argentina-SEGBA V Power Distribution Project and the Paraguay-Reform
         Project for the Water and Telecommunication Sector. The Project consists of a 65
         kilometer (km) earthen dam in the main channel of the Paraná River about 80 km
         from the cities of Posadas, Argentina, and Encarnación, Paraguay (see Map 1). It
         comprises a low-head hydroelectric facility (with 20 Kaplan turbines of 155
         megawatts (MW) each for a total generating capacity of 3,100 MW), as well as a
         navigation lock, a fish passage, and other support facilities. The Project also
         provides for a large program of infrastructure relocation, population resettlement,
         and environmental impact mitigation. The earthen dam, with a uniform height of
         86 m, creates a reservoir of 1065 square km, which, if filled to its design level of
         83 masl, will flood over 107,000 hectares9 and have major impacts on the urban
         areas of Encarnación and Posadas. In 1992, the dam was estimated to affect about
         10,600 families in both countries.10 Because of the constant influx of people into
         the project area, the number of people that will be affected by Yacyretá had
         climbed in 2002 to nearly 18,000 families.11 Presently the dam operates at
         approximately 60 percent of its capacity, at a reservoir level of 76 masl.

2.       The Federación de Afectados por Yacyretá de Itapúa y Misiones
         (FEDAYIM),12 a Paraguayan non-governmental organization, submitted the
         Request for Inspection on its own behalf as well as on behalf of more than 4,000
         families who believe that their lives and well-being are affected by the Yacyretá

         Hydroelectric Dam. Six coordinators of affected people in the Paraguayan areas
         of San Cosme y Damián, Distrito Cambyreta, Barrio Pacu Cúa, Barrio Santa
         Rosa, M'boy Caé, Arroyo Potí'y, and Barrio Santa Rosa also signed the Request.

3.       On May 30, 2002, the Panel registered the Request and notified the Bank's Board
         of Executive Directors (the "Board") and the President of its receipt.

1.2. The Request

4.       According to the Request, more than 4,000 families "affected by pending
         liabilities"13 living in the areas directly affected by the Yacyretá Hydroelectric
         Project are suffering adverse social and environmental consequences because of
         the raising of the Yacyretá power plant's reservoir to 76 masl or, allegedly,
         higher. The Requesters claim that the raising of the reservoir to its current level
         has had severe environmental impacts, such as constant flooding of urban creeks,
         a higher water table, contamination of the Paraná River and the creeks, and
         spreading of diseases. The Requesters allege that this has forced them to live in
         unbearable conditions.

5.       The Request also contends that a proposed wastewater treatment plant, to be built
         under the Project, would further pollute the environment because its location and
         design are based on a defective environmental assessment and are in violation of
         national environmental laws.14

6.       According to the Requesters, the families affected by the raising of the reservoir
         were neither appropriately identified nor adequately quantified. As a result,
         thousands of them were excluded from existing compensation and mitigation
         programs, in spite of the fact that they have owned and occupied lands affected by
         the construction of the dam for more than twenty years.

7.       The Request states also that the resettlement programs, provided under the
         Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project and partially financed with various Bank loans,
         are not being properly implemented. This has left hundreds of affected families
         and businesses with no or inadequate compensation, poor resettlement housing
         and facilities, and prolonged economic hardship. The Request gives particular
         attention to the situation of the employees of the brick-making and ceramic
         factories who allegedly have not been compensated for their loss of income
         because only factory owners, and not their workers, were compensated for their
         losses.




13Request, 1. The Request uses the term "pending liability" to refer to social and environmental activities
that the Entidad Nacional Yacyretá (EBY) needed to implement before raising the reservoir to 76 masl but,
according to the Requesters, has not.
14The Panel does not comment on matters related to compliance with national legislation of Bank member
countries.


                                                                                                          4

8.    The Requesters allege that the Bank's actions and omissions constitute violations
      of various provisions of Bank Policies and Procedures: OD 4.01 on
      Environmental Assessment; OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement; OD/OP/BP
      13.05 on Project Supervision; OD 10.70 on Project Monitoring and Evaluation;
      OD 13.40 on Suspension of Disbursements; and OD 4.00 Annex B on
      Environmental Policy for Dam and Reservoir Projects.

1.3. Management Response

9.    On July 10, 2002, the Panel received the Management Response to the Inspection
      Panel Request, which is briefly summarized below.

10.   In its Response, Management asserts that it has complied with all relevant Bank
      policies and procedures and that it strives to address all social and environmental
      concerns of the people living in the project areas. It acknowledges, however, that
      the Project's implementation has encountered serious problems over the years and
      that these have yet to be fully resolved. Management states that it has maintained
      its financing of and engagement in the Yacyretá Project and has avoided
      exercising the available legal remedies against the Borrower because, in
      Management's judgment, the Project is best served by such actions.

11.   Management emphasizes that there is no causal relationship between a number of
      the problems documented in the Request and the raising of the reservoir's level to
      the current 76 masl. Consequently Management contends that the problems of
      urban creek flooding, water contamination, environmental pollution, and adverse
      health impacts on the population have not been caused by the reservoir.
      Management attributes these problems either to natural factors, such as increased
      rainfall, or to human actions unrelated to the reservoir, namely clogging of the
      creeks with garbage.

12.   The Response also emphasizes that EBY will finance and supervise the
      construction of a new sewage collection system and a wastewater treatment plan
      in Encarnación, Paraguay, whose location, although strongly disputed by some
      segments of the population, is based on an adequate environmental assessment
      and the advice of independent consultants.

13.   In response to the claim that thousands of families have been excluded from the
      compensation and mitigation programs, Management states that appropriate
      compensation and adequate resettlement have been provided to all the affected
      families and businesses that were identified through censuses conducted in 1980
      and 1990. With regard to the issue of lack of compensation to brick-makers and
      ceramists, the Response contends that "[d]uring the period 1994 to 1996, when
      discussion about compensation to brick and roof tile makers was under way [sic],
      the Bank as well as EBY worked under the assumption that Paraguayan labor
      laws would be applied effectively. As a result, analysis and discussion were
      focused on compensating owners of brick and tile making businesses and it was



                                                                                       5

         assumed that employers would proceed according to the law and properly
         compensate their employees."15

1.4. Eligibility of the Request

14.      To determine the eligibility of the Request and the Requesters, the Panel reviewed
         the Request for Inspection and the Management Response and, in July 2002,
         visited Encarnación, Paraguay, and other relevant Project areas, including
         Posadas, Argentina.

15.      During the field visit, the then Panel Chairman16 Edward S. Ayensu met with
         representatives of the FEDAYIM, government officials, local officials, and
         affected people in the project area and with government and EBY officials in
         Asunción.       In Buenos Aires, Argentina, he met with government and EBY
         officials and NGO representatives. Before and after the visit to Argentina and
         Paraguay, the Panel consulted with the Bank's Executive Director and the
         Alternate Executive Director representing Argentina and Paraguay and with their
         staff.

16.      The Panel determined that the Request fulfilled the eligibility requirements for
         Inspection. Because the Request and the Management Response contain
         conflicting assertions and interpretations concerning the issues, the facts,
         compliance with Bank policies and procedures, actual harm, and potential harm,
         the Panel recommended an investigation to the Board of Executive Directors.

1.5. The Board Decision

17.      On September 9, 2002, the Board approved the Panel's recommendation to
         conduct an investigation into the matters alleged in the Request for Inspection.
         The Request, the Management Response, and the Panel's Report and
         Recommendation were made public shortly after the Board decided to authorize
         the inspection sought by the Requesters.

1.6. The Investigation

18.      The purpose of the investigation was to establish whether the Bank violated its
         own policies and procedures in the design and implementation of the Yacyretá
         Hydroelectric Project--and of the Asunción Sewerage Project to the extent that it
         relates to Yacyretá17--and whether, if violations were found, they caused, or are
         likely to cause, harm to the Requesters and the people they represent.


15Management Response, ¶ 135.
16Because of the expiration of his term of office as a Panel member, Professor Ayensu's chairmanship of
the Panel ended on July 31, 2003. He was succeeded by Professor Edith Brown Weiss.
17The Asunción Sewerage Project, financed by Loan No. 3842-PA approved on February 14, 1995, is
aimed at, inter alia, improving the living conditions of 3,000 inhabitants of Encarnación, who were to be
resettled under the Second Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project, by providing related infrastructure works. In


                                                                                                         6

19.      Panel Chairman Edith Brown Weiss led a two-part investigation. The first part
         involved detailed research into Bank records related to the Project and interviews
         with Bank management and staff. The second part took the form of four in-
         country fact-finding visits. To assist in its investigation, the Panel hired three
         consultants, who are internationally recognized experts in their respective fields:
         Professor Richard Fuggle, environmental scientist, Dr. Paul Taylor, social
         scientist, and Professor Carlos Tucci, hydrologist.18

20.      Panel member Edith Brown Weiss, accompanied by Executive Secretary Eduardo
         Abbott, initially visited Argentina and Paraguay in October 2002. A second visit
         to the project area followed in January 2003. Then Panel Chairman Edward S.
         Ayensu and the expert consultants, supported by the Panel Secretariat,
         accompanied Lead Inspector Edith Brown Weiss. The Panel conducted additional
         visits in May 2003 and December 2003 to clarify and to verify information
         gathered in the course of the investigation.      19


21.      In its investigation, the Panel identified and carefully reviewed all documents
         relevant to the case that the Requesters, Bank staff, IDB staff, EBY officials, and
         other sources provided to the Panel. The Panel also analyzed other evidence
         gathered during the field visits or otherwise in its research.

22.      The Panel conducted interviews with the Bank's staff in Washington, D.C. before
         and after visiting the project affected areas. During its field visits, the Panel met
         extensively with the Requesters, with high officials of the governments of
         Argentina and Paraguay, and with EBY officials and staff, who had an open and
         frank dialogue with the Panel and were very helpful in assisting in its
         investigation. Consistent with its mandate, it independently visited the project
         areas and consulted with affected people.

23.      This Report presents the results of the Panel's investigation.                     Chapter One
         presents the history of the Project and identifies significant factors affecting the
         Project's completion. Chapters 2 ­ 4 address specific issues raised in the Request
         for Inspection or presented to the Panel during its visits to the Project's affected
         areas.




2000, the Asunción Sewerage Project was restructured and renamed "Reform Project for the Water and
Telecommunications Sectors." See infra §§ 2.2.3, 4.2.3, 4.3.3, and 4.4.2 for an analysis of this project in
connection with Yacyretá.

19During the Panel's visits, Panel members were assisted by Panel Executive Secretary Eduardo Abbott,
Professor Richard Fuggle, Professor Carlos Tucci, and Dr. Paul Taylor, consultant Tatiana Tassoni, and
interpreters Rut Simcovich, Lillian Gentile, Marina Pou, and Fernanda Font.

                          2. THE YACYRETÁ HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT


24.      The Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project, a joint venture between Argentina and
         Paraguay, is a multi-billion US dollar hydroelectric facility constructed on the
         Paraná River along the border between the two countries. At design capacity (and
         a reservoir level of 83 masl), Yacyretá would generate 3,100 MW of electricity.
         Currently it operates at about 60 percent of its capacity with a reservoir level of
         76 masl. To implement the project, a semi-autonomous, bi-national entity, the
         Entidad Binacional Yacyretá (EBY), was created in 1973, with equal
         representation of the two countries on its Board of Directors as well as at other
         administrative levels.

2.1. Historical Background: 80 Years of Yacyretá.

25.      The Paraná River is a tributary of the Rio de la Plata, which borders Argentina
         and Brazil. The idea of damming the Paraná river in the vicinity of the Yacyretá
         island to improve navigation through the Apipé rapids was first conceived in
         1920, when the Argentine government commissioned a series of studies focused
         initially on improving navigation and eventually on assessing the rapids'
         hydroelectric potential as well.20 In 1926, Argentina and Paraguay laid the basis
         for the future Yacyretá project by signing a protocol that envisaged using
         common waters to generate and share energy.21 In 1958, Argentina and Paraguay
         formed the Comisión Mixta Técnica Paraguayo-Argentina (CMT), a bi-national
         entity that can be considered the predecessor of the EBY.22                          The CMT was
         charged with conducting the pre-feasibility study of Yacyretá, which was
         completed in 1964.23

26.      In 1971, CMT hired an international consortium of consultants, Harza y
         Consorciados ("Harza"), to prepare a feasibility study for a Yacyretá
         hydroelectric project.24 The study was completed in December 1973.

2342-AR (September 21, 1979), 15 [hereinafter "1979 SAR"]; Gustavo Lins Ribeiro, Transnational

Florida, 1994), 31.
21Acuerdo Sobre El Mejoramiento De La Navegabilidad Del Rio Alto Paraná Y Utilización De Las Caídas
De Agua En Apipe Suscripto Ad Referendum De Los Gobiernos. The protocol authorized Argentina to
conduct the work and the studies needed to utilize the common waters in the Paraná River. It established as
well that, in the case of Yacyretá, , the rapids utilized to exploit part of the energy were jointly owned by
the two countries. Finally, the protocol foresaw the possibility of making use of Paraguayan territory to
execute the project, and the need to expropriate lands.
22 See infra § 2.1.2.
23Ribeiro, Transnational Capitalism and Hydropolitics in Argentina, 35.
24Ibid., 35­36. The author reports that in 1969 the then West German government made a loan to
Argentina to carry out studies for the development of the future Yacyretá project. The competitive bidding,
in which five consortia of firms participated, was launched in early 1971. By mid -1971, CMT announced
the winner: Harza y Consorciados, a consortium comprised of Harza Engineering, a firm from Chicago,
one German firm, two Argentine firms, and one Paraguayan firm.


                                                                                                             8

27.      On the basis of these studies, Argentina and Paraguay signed during the same
         month the Tratado de Yacyretá (Treaty of Yacyretá), formalizing the agreement to
         construct the dam and undertake the hydroelectric project.25 In 1974, Harza was
         once again contracted to prepare the Project's final design.26 Construction began
         in 1983.

28.      The Yacyretá dam is but one of three dams that have been proposed to exploit the
         hydroelectric potential of the Paraná River. The other two proposed dams were at
         Itaipú, and Corpus. Only the Yacyretá and Itaipú dams have been built.27

29.       The Itaipú Dam links Brazil and Paraguay in exploiting the Paraná River. The
         two countries agreed on common exploitation of the river in 1966.28 In April
         1973, they concluded the Treaty of Itaipú for the "hydroelectric development of
         the [river's] hydraulic resources."29 The Itaipú dam, constructed pursuant to this
         treaty, is located upstream from the Yacyretá dam on the Paraná River.

30.      The third proposed dam, Corpus, has yet to be built. If built, Corpus will be co-
         owned by Argentina and Paraguay and will create "hydrologic interdependency
         between these three dams."30 Recognition of this potential interdependency led in
         1979 to the signing of a trilateral agreement between Argentina, Paraguay, and
         Brazil for the exploitation of the Paraná's hydroelectric potential.31

2.1.1. Treaty of Yacyretá

31.      On December 3, 1973, Argentina and Paraguay ("the Parties") concluded the
         Treaty of Yacyretá.32 It includes three annexes dealing respectively with statutes,

         project components, and financial arrangements.33 The Parties have subsequently
         amended the Treaty and expanded their commitments through letters of
         agreement (in Spanish, cartas or notas reversales) exchanged between the two
         countries.

32.      The Treaty provides for: (a) exploiting the hydroelectric potential of the Paraná
         River; (b) improving navigation in the vicinity of Yacyretá Island; and (c)
         mitigating the effects of severe river floods.34 As part of the Treaty, Argentina
         and Paraguay agreed, inter alia, to establish the EBY as a bi-national government
         entity responsible for implementing the hydroelectric project.35 The countries are
         to share equally ownership of the dam and all related works,36 including the
         energy generated.37 The Treaty provides that the energy produced by the
         hydroelectric facility will be divided in equal parts between the two countries and
         that each country will have a preferential right to acquire the energy not used by
         the other.38 The Treaty further requires that Argentina and Paraguay guarantee
         free navigation on the natural course of the Paraná and through the planned
         locks.39 The Treaty also mandates that the Parties declare the areas necessary for
         the hydroelectric development as essential for public utility and places the
         responsibility for the demarcation of such areas on the Yacyretá bi-national
         entity.40 The bi-national entity will also be responsible for payment of
         compensation for expropriated lands.41

33.      Annex B of the Treaty addresses the hydroelectric project. The project's main
         structure, an earthen dike, would be located in the vicinity of Yacyretá Island.
         The dike and two concrete closure dams across the Paraná River would create a
         reservoir normally at 83 masl, when full, in the area between the power plant and
         Posadas/Encarnación.42 The Parties also agreed that the works set forth in Annex
         B could be modified, subject to approval by EBY's Board of Directors, should
         this be technically necessary or required by the energy market.43 Indeed, in 1979

Entidad Binacional Yacyretá. Annex B contains the general description of the installations for the
production of electric energy and improvement of conditions of navigability, and of complementary works
for the development of the Paraná River; in other words, it lays out the project. Finally, Annex C consists
of the bases for financing and for provision of electricity services by Yacyretá.

42The original treaty, at Annex B, provided for a maximum water level of 82 masl. In 1979, Annex B was
modified by Letter of Agreement No. 11 (August 30, 1979) to allow an additional elevation of 0.70 masl.
Finally, in 1989, Letter of Agreement No. 3 (April 26, 1989) provided that "according to the latest studies,
the maximum inundation of Paraguayan territory will not be greater than 815 km², determined with the
level 83 masl as the inundation level in the area between the Yacyretá power plant and
Posadas/Encarnación."

         Annex B was amended in order to modify the original dam alignment, following a
         lingering dispute between Argentina and Paraguay over the amount of Paraguayan
         territory slated to be flooded because of the dam.44 Pursuant to the amendment,
         the maximum inundation in Paraguay would not be more than 815 km², as
         opposed to the 910 km² originally established in the Treaty.

34.      As noted above, Argentina and Paraguay amended and expanded the provisions of
         their original accord through the exchange of letters of agreement. The Panel
         notes here two of the most important:

         · In 1979 the parties amended Annex C, which regulates their financial
              arrangements in relation to the project.               As amended, the Treaty grants
              Argentina and Paraguay the right to be compensated in proportion to the
              amount of land to be flooded in their respective countries.45
         · In January 1992 (pending the approval of the third Bank loan in support of the
              Yacyretá project, Loan 3520-AR), Argentina and Paraguay agreed with a nota
              reversal to start power generation between March and September 1994. The
              amendment also set out a work plan for filling the reservoir (in Spanish,
              Cronograma de obras). It was agreed that the filling was to be carried out on
              a reduced scale to dam level 76 masl in the first year, to 78 masl in 1995.46
              The Nota does not indicate precisely when the Project would reach 84masl.47
              However, the 1992 Staff Appraisal Report for the Second Yacyretá
              Hydroelectric Project stated that the project "would be completed in its
              entirety by June 1998".48

2.1.2. Entidad Binacional Yacyretá (EBY)

35.      Article III of the Treaty of Yacyretá created a bi-national entity, Entidad
         Binacional Yacyretá (EBY). EBY was formally established on September 6,
         1974, with headquarters in Asunción, Paraguay, and Buenos Aires, Argentina.
         EBY's statute is included in Annex A of the Treaty.

36.      The Treaty granted EBY full juridical, financial, and administrative capacity and
         assigned it the technical responsibility of studying, planning, directing, and
         executing the hydroelectric project.49 The Treaty determined that Agua y Energia

         Electrica of Argentina (AyE), the Argentine national power company, and
         Administración Nacional de Electricidad of Paraguay (ANDE), the Paraguayan
         national power company, were to form EBY with equal participation in its
         capital.50

37.      EBY is administered by a Board of Directors (Consejo de Administración) and an
         Executive Committee (Comite Ejecutivo), whose functions and responsibilities
         are spelled out in Annex A of the Treaty. The Board of Directors establishes the
         general policies of Yacyretá and approves important proposals made by the
         Executive Committee, such as loans and other contracts. It has eight members,
         four from each country.             The Executive Committee includes the Executive
         Director from Argentina and the Executive Director from Paraguay. They are
         assisted by Chiefs of Departments (Technical, Finance, Administrative, and
         Environment and Resettlement) and are in charge of carrying out the
         administrative duties for the execution of the project.

38.      According to documents made available to the Panel, EBY's mirror-like
         management organization, where Argentina and Paraguay equally share
         responsibilities, has proven to be inefficient and cumbersome.51 Management
         itself acknowledges, in its response to the Request for Inspection, that EBY's
         management structure "was not ideally suited to implement the important but
         difficult aspects of the Yacyretá Project outside the technical sphere."52 It adds
         that "[a]lthough EBY was able to put in place and retain highly qualified and
         experienced technical staff, it does not have the necessary management expertise
         and skills to implement the environmental mitigation and social protection
         measures which are an integral part of the project."53

39.      Increasingly, EBY has had to assume public responsibilities that usually would be
         taken on by local and national governments and that are well beyond its original
         tasks as project implementing agency.54 EBY has been entrusted with providing
         basic services to the local population as well as with responsibilities ranging from
         health, sanitation, and safety to flood mitigation and river basin protection. It has
         gradually turned into "a government authority without parallel in the local
         region,"55 whose shortfalls, however, have naturally led to profound distrust from
         affected people, community leaders, and NGOs, particularly in Paraguay.


Integración de América Latina y el Caribe, 1982, 7:41, 48. The study concludes that EBY can be
considered an "empresa pública internacional" (public international entity) that is subject to a special
juridical regime, which differentiates it from other public or private entities in both Argentina and
Paraguay. The study also cites contradicting articles.

40.       EBY's institutional weakness, the excessively broad range of its activities, and the
          mistrust of the area's affected people are considered by many to be key factors
          that have adversely affected Project execution and have created a situation that
          seems very difficult to solve.

2.2. Project Financing

2.2.1. Local Funds

41.       Under the Treaty, the government of Argentina agreed to be initially the sole
          financer of the Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project. Paraguay would pay its share
          after the Project was completed and operational. The Treaty established that AyE
          and ANDE, the two companies forming EBY, would provide the necessary
          capital.56    Each of the two contracting parties, provided the other consented,
          would advance the necessary resources under conditions to be mutually
          established.57 Pursuant to these provisions, in December 1973 Argentina agreed,
          in letter of agreement no. 21, to lend ANDE, the Paraguayan national power
          company, US$50,000,000. This money was to be used by ANDE in contributing
          its share of EBY's capital.58           In an additional letter of agreement, Argentina
          agreed to guarantee any credit obtained by EBY to purchase goods and services
          required for the Project's execution.59              In 1976, a further letter of agreement
          designated the Banco de la Nación Argentina as the financial institution that
          would open the credit line to Paraguay's ANDE for the purpose of contributing its
          share of capital to EBY.60

2.2.2. The Third Owners' Agreement

42.       The Bank and the governments of Argentina and Paraguay entered into three
          successive Owners' Agreements. The first two (dated November 6, 1979, and
          November 18, 1988) dealt with the establishment and operation of EBY and the
          carrying out of the Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project.                        The Third Owners'
          Agreement, signed on November 16, 1992, as amended on December 11, 1997,
          added specific obligations for both countries with regard to, inter alia, the social
          and environmental mitigation measures included in the so-called "Base Program"

of the treaty provides that EBY is formed by the Argentinean national power company (AyE) and the
Paraguayan one (ANDE), which, according to Art. VIII, will also provide the resources necessary to
constitute the capital of Yacyretá. Art. VIII also establishes that either contracting party can advance, with
the consent of the other, the resources to constitute the capital of EBY, under mutually agreed-upon terms.

          and the "Pending Action Program" (also known as Plans A and B61), which relate
          to the raising of the reservoir to 76 masl and its prolonged operation at this level.62
          The Third Owners' Agreement, as amended, also established specific conditions
          for the raising of the reservoir beyond 76 masl and provided that Argentina and
          Paraguay would finance the resettlement of the so-called "additional families"
          living in the project areas in Argentina and Paraguay but not included in the
          1989/1990 census (in Spanish, the "extra-censales").63 Finally, both countries
          committed themselves not to transfer the ownership or operation of the Project
          unless the execution of all social and environmental mitigation programs is
          adequately guaranteed by EBY's successor.64

2.2.3. World Bank Financial Support for the Project

43.       Because of the Project's size and cost, Argentina and Paraguay sought financial
          support in 1976 from, inter alia, the Bank.65 In 1979, the Bank approved the first
          loan financing the Yacyretá Project--Loan 1761-AR--as part of a Bank program
          aimed at supporting the expansion of Argentina's power sector.66

44.       From the very beginning, the Project encountered substantial financial problems
          and implementation difficulties. These ranged from a dispute between the Bank
          and the government of Argentina over procurement issues, to Argentina's
          economic recession and high inflation during 1983 and 1984,67 to legal and
          institutional constraints on EBY's work, especially in Paraguay.68

45.       Although the Project remained essentially the same over the years, to address
          emerging problems the Bank's support took a number of forms, ranging from
          direct lending to amendment and reallocation of funds of existing loans. In 1988,
          the Bank approved a new Bank loan to finance civil works and other engineering
          contracts.69 The loan was granted after a new Argentine government reassessed
          the Project and proposed some adjustments to its design and implementation.

63Ibid. Paragraph 16 (Loan Agreement amendments) and paragraph 47 (Third Owners' Agreement
amendments), define additional families as "families requiring resettlement as a result of the raising of the
level of the reservoir of the Yacyretá power plant, which families settled in the area of the reservoir
subsequent to completion of the census that served as a basis for preparing the original EMP and were
thus not covered by said census."

66According to the 1979 SAR, in 1962 the Bank approved the first of a series of loans aimed at supporting
the Argentine power sector. In particular, the report states that the Bank was instrumental in helping
Argentina to prepare a national power expansion program based on least-cost criteria for the period 1985 to
2000. 1979 SAR, 3­4.

46.      Argentina's overall financial problems, far from being solved, gradually
         worsened. In 1991, the Argentinean government decided yet again to reassess the
         Yacyretá Project, which was still affected by long delays in implementation.70
         Based on the determination of the governments of Argentina and Paraguay that
         project completion was justified on economical and financial grounds, the Bank
         decided in 1992 to renew its support for Yacyretá by approving a new loan, Loan
         3520-AR, which financed the so-called Second Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project.71

47.      Two years later, in 1994, undisbursed funds from an additional Bank loan
         approved in 1988 to support Argentina's power expansion program--Loan 2854-
         AR financing the SEGBA V Power Distribution Project--were reallocated to
         allow US$135 million equivalent to be used for Yacyretá. In particular, these
         funds were to be used to ensure appropriate environmental protection and
         efficient handling of the social aspects of the Project.72

48.      Loans 3520-AR and 2854-AR were subsequently amended in 1997 to grant
         Yacyretá increased financial support.73 The amendment also financed two new
         Action Plans, Plan A and Plan B, which the Bank and the two countries concluded
         to deal with the severe difficulties affecting the project.74 Plan A provided for the
         completion of the resettlement and environmental actions that should have been,
         but were not, implemented before raising the reservoir's water level to 76 masl.
         Plan B was to deal with several problems emerging as a consequence of the
         prolonged staying of the water level at 76 masl.

49.      In addition, a Bank loan to the government of Paraguay (Loan 3842-PA for the
         Asunción Sewerage Project) provided financial support for a component of the
         Project's resettlement program. The Asunción Sewerage Project--now called
         "Reform Project for the Water and Telecommunication Sectors"--was approved
         by the Bank in 1995 and included, inter alia, the financing of infrastructure works
         for the benefit of about 3,000 people to be resettled under the Project.
         Specifically, Part C of the Project's description, set forth in Schedule 2 to the
         Loan Agreement, reads, "Civil Works in Encarnación...[c]onstruction of
         infrastructure works, including, inter alia, (a) a water supply and sewage disposal
         facilities, (b) roads; (c) storm water drainage and solid wastes disposal facilities;

2.3. The Project Design

52.      The Yacyretá Project's civil works consist of two 40-meter-high, five-kilometer-
         long concrete closure dams, 60 kilometers of embankment dam with a maximum
         height of 41 meters and a uniform crest level of 86 masl,76 and a 56-kilometer-
         long trench of cement bentonite slurry to cut off foundation seepage.77 The works
         also include a 1.2-kilometer-long, 77-meter-wide powerhouse, spillways, and a
         270-meter-long, 27-meter-wide navigation lock on the main branch of the river.78
         The dam was designed to be maintained at a level of 83 masl and for a flood
         height of 84.5 masl.79

53.      At full capacity, the water level in the reservoir would reach 83 masl, but raising
         the reservoir to that level would require resettlement of all affected populations to
         sites above 84 masl.80 At 83 masl, the reservoir will cover an area of 1663 km2,
         inundating 1076 km2 of land and 574 km2 of existing river. Of the land area
         inundated, close to 73 percent would be in Paraguay and 27 percent in
         Argentina.81 At this level, 1,500 hectares of cultivated land will be flooded as
         well as 500 hectares of urban land in cities and towns. It was initially anticipated
         that the inundation would cause the involuntary resettlement of about 50,000
         persons, mostly from the cities of Posadas and Encarnación.82 This number has
         been significantly increasing over the years, however, because of a constant,
         uncontrolled influx of people into the project area (see Map 2).


2.3.1. The Site of the Power Plant

54.      Annex B of the Yacyretá Treaty describes the components of the hydroelectric
         project and establishes that the power plant, the principal structure, would be
         located on the Paraná River near Yacyretá Island.83 The island divides the river
         into two channels, the Aña Cua and the principal branches where two closure
         dams and spillways have also been built. With a normal elevation of 83 masl, the
         water from the reservoir will flood approximately 1,663 km², of which 852 are in

55.     When Argentina and Paraguay sought World Bank financing for the Project in
        1976, one of the Project's critical decisions, the location of the principal structure,
        had already been taken and fixed by the Treaty of Yacyretá. In the opinion of
        experts the location chosen for the Yacyretá power plant was highly unsuited for
        the construction and operation of a dam. It is located on the flood plain of a major
        river thereby causing inundation of a large area and displacement of many people.

2.3.2. The Resettlement Programs

56.     According to the 1992 Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), at the elevation of 78 masl,
        the reservoir was to displace about 3,250 families (16,250 persons) in the cities of
        Posadas, Argentina, and Encarnación, Paraguay.85 If the reservoir were to be
        filled to 83 masl, about 5,050 families (25,250 persons) were originally to be
        resettled.86 However, these figures have increased considerably over the years
        because of a constant influx of people into the project affected areas. The families
        affected by the Yacyretá project are referred to as "affected population."

57.     Under the resettlement programs, the affected population was defined as "all
        persons who lose their home, means of livelihood, or both as a result of the

841979 SAR, Annex A, 52. At 78 masl, the reservoir would inundate about 38,000 hectares of sparsely
populated wildlands in Paraguay, and at full operation (83 masl) it would inundate another 78,000 of these
hectares.

         construction of the Yacyretá civil works, whether or not they are owners of the
         home or land expropriated by the project87", and who were identified as affected
         in the 1989/1990 resettlement census.88 The Appraisal Report states that families
         migrating to the project affected area after the census were not to be covered
         under the Bank-approved resettlement plan, because their resettlement is the
         responsibility of the respective local governments with EBY's assistance and in a
         form acceptable to the Bank.89 In addition, the Bank-approved resettlement
         program90 established that the "population affected by loss of home, means of
         livelihood or both will be entitled to a choice of monetary compensation or a full
         replacement at no cost to the affected persons91"

2.3.2.1. The Programa Desborde de Arroyos (PDA)

58.      The Programa Desborde de Arroyos (Urban Creeks Program or PDA) was
         developed in 1998 to resettle people affected by frequent flooding of urban creeks
         in both Posadas and Encarnación. The program addresses the situation of families
         who live in serious unsanitary conditions along urban creeks in areas between 78
         and 84 masl and provides for their advanced resettlement. These families are
         comprised of affected people who would be relocated anyway under the main
         resettlement program (the 1992 RRAP) in the context of the plans to raise the
         reservoir to 83 masl. Under the PDA, the relocation of these people has been
         assigned a higher priority so as to minimize the impact of future creek floods.92
         According to Management, the PDA program constructs houses and infrastructure
         for resettled families and provides assistance to these families before, during, and
         after their relocation.93

59.      The PDA program also includes the construction of 674 houses for families
         already living in the resettlement site of Itá Paso. Families resettled in Itá Paso
         belong to the so-called "extra-censales" group whose resettlement is financed by
         the government of Paraguay under the Third Owners' Agreement.94 Although
         these families were not affected by urban creek flooding, they have been included
         in the PDA. The government of Paraguay had provided Itá Paso with inadequate
         services and poor infrastructure, and by including these families in the program,
         their living conditions could be improved.95

60.      Management reports that in 2000 the Bank "expressed to EBY its willingness to
         amend Loan 2854-AR to allow use of resources from this loan in support of the
         PDA." However, notes Management, "EBY did not pursue this avenue."96

2.3.3. The Environmental Mitigation Activities

61.      The Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared in 1992 during the preparation
         of the Second Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project to be financed by Loan 3520-AR
         and identified the Project's impact on, inter alia, the aquatic life, water quality,
         wildlands and biodiversity, forestry, water-borne diseases, and cultural property.
         A subsequent Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was designed to address
         and mitigate the Project's negative impacts. The Bank would finance, inter alia,
         design studies for the management of the protected areas created by the Project,
         design studies for water supply and sewerage and sanitation systems for the city
         of Encarnación and Posadas, design studies for reservoir water release
         management, and the monitoring of disease vectors. EBY agreed to implement
         the EMP according to a timetable of dates between 1992 and 1998.97

62.      According to Project documents, if the governments of Paraguay and Argentina
         agreed to raise the level of the reservoir above 78 masl, EBY would review the
         Resettlement and Environmental Management Plan (REMP) accordingly. The
         Bank would only endorse the decision to raise the reservoir level if it deemed that
         implementation of the new REMP and its financing were satisfactory.98

2.4. 20 Years of Implementation

2.4.1. Implementation Problems

63.      The execution of Yacyretá's main civil works began in December 1983, a decade
         after Argentina and Paraguay concluded the Yacyretá Treaty. More than twenty
         years into the implementation, the completion of the project remains a distant
         goal. The execution of the environmental and social activities has constantly
         stumbled from a lack of funds, EBY's weak and transient managerial capacity,
         and the two countries' economic and political turmoil. The following paragraphs
         present a brief account of the Yacyretá Project's implementation history to
         illustrate the context in which the present Request for Inspection and the one
         submitted to the Panel in 1996 developed.

64.      When the Bank first appraised the Project in September 1979, the execution of the
         main civil works was scheduled to start shortly thereafter and the filling of the
         reservoir was planned to begin in 1985. However, because of disputes between
         Argentina and Paraguay over the dam alignment, and Argentina's financial and

                                                                                          21

         political problems, the start of the civil works was postponed.                   99  Construction
         finally began in late 1983. Almost ten years later, in 1992, when the Bank re-
         appraised the project for a new loan in support of Yacyretá, 80 percent of the civil
         works had been completed, while EBY had implemented only 60 percent of the
         resettlement and environmental activities provided under the hydroelectric
         project.100

65.      In January 1992, the continuing difficulties in obtaining financing to complete the
         project forced Argentina and Paraguay to opt for a phased project implementation.
         Accordingly, after lengthy negotiations, and with the assistance of Bank staff, the
         countries agreed upon a work plan to fill the reservoir in stages. The water level
         would be raised to 76 masl in 1994, to 78 masl in 1995, and to 83 masl in 1998.101

66.      The Yacyretá reservoir was filled to 76 masl in May 1994, as anticipated. EBY
         moved ahead with the implementation of the reservoir-filling schedule after
         obtaining approval from the Bank and IDB but prior to completing the required
         resettlement and environmental measures.

67.      After the reservoir was raised to 76 masl, severe drawbacks in the execution of
         the resettlement operations, including lack of a proper expropriation law in
         Paraguay, practically stopped the phased implementation. In 1996, when the
         Panel received the first Request for Inspection concerning the Yacyretá
         Hydroelectric Project, many activities that should have been completed prior to
         filling the reservoir were still pending, and the prolonged staying of the water
         level at 76 masl had created unexpected environmental and social problems that
         have yet to be fully solved.

68.      A few years later, in 1998, an Independent Advisory Panel assembled by the Bank
         to advise on "options surrounding future reservoir operating levels"102 noted that
         "every time a decision had to be made about additional financing, the continued
         viability of the project depended on timely and cost effective implementation.
         However, this history also shows that after financing was secured, the efficiency
         preconditions were never met."103

69.      Presently, the future of Yacyretá remains unclear. The problems affecting the
         execution of the social and environmental activities persist, making project
         completion a difficult challenge. In spite of this, EBY and the governments of
         Argentina and Paraguay are still considering whether to bring the reservoir's
         water level to its design height of 83 masl, for which, however, the Bank must

Project. See supra § 2.4.5, ¶78.
101See 1992 SAR, 19. The report states that the initial operation of the reservoir at a reduced level would
have allowed the postponement of investments in, for example, resettlement, environmental mitigation and
land acquisition.

        issue its "no objection" endorsement.104 In this regard, it is worth noting that
        Management confirmed to the Panel during the investigation that the
        implementation of the environmental and social activities remains the essential
        requirement that EBY must fulfill before the Bank will consider issuing its
        approval to fill the reservoir beyond its current 76 masl level.105

2.4.2. First Request for Inspection to the Panel

70.     On September 30, 1996, the Panel received a Request for Inspection from
        SOBREVIVENCIA-Friends of the Earth Paraguay representing affected people
        concerning the Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project.106 The Requesters alleged that
        adverse environmental, health, and socioeconomic impacts had occurred as a
        result of the filling of the Yacyretá reservoir to 76 masl and of the Bank's failure
        to supervise adequately the environmental mitigation and resettlement activities
        conducted under the Project. In December 1996, the Panel recommended that the
        Bank's Board of Executive Directors authorize the investigation into the matters
        alleged into this Request for Inspection.

2.4.3. Action Plans A and B

71.     On February 1997 at the Board meeting held to discuss the Panel's
        recommendation, Management presented two action plans agreed upon with
        Argentina and Paraguay, the "Pending Action Program" and the "Base Program"
        (so-called Action Plans A and B), developed to address the Project's outstanding
        problems. Plan A related to those actions that should have been completed, but
        were not, before filling the reservoir to 76 masl.                   Plan B proposed the
        implementation of activities necessary to continue the operation of the reservoir at
        76 masl in a socially and environmentally sound manner.

72.     In Paraguay, Plan A included actions such as the indemnification of brick- and
        tile-makers in Encarnación, the issuance of property titles to resettled families,
        and the completion of infrastructure works and housing for the rural settlement of
        San Juan del Paraná.107 According to the July 2002 Management Response, albeit
        with delays Plan A was fully completed in 1999.108

73.     Plan B identified several social and environmental activities necessary for the
        prolonged operation of the reservoir at 76 masl. With respect to the resettlement
        program, Plan B required the relocation of all families included in the 1990
        census who lived in the areas up to 78 masl; the resettlement of all post-1990

         prevent further settlement in the affected areas.              As to the environmental
         mitigation activities, the plan included, inter alia, construction of the sewerage
         system for the city of Encarnación, relocation of the city's slaughterhouse,
         construction of the municipal market in Encarnación, conduction of various
         biodiversity activities, and completion of hydro-geological studies of ground
         water in the Paraná River Basin.109 According to Management, the
         implementation of Plan B is nearing completion.110

74.      Plans A and B were incorporated into the legal documents for Loans 2854-AR
         and 3520-AR through amendments dated December 11, 1997.111


2.4.4. Board Decision

75.      In view of the agreement between Management and the government of Argentina
         and Paraguay on the action plans, the Board did not authorize the investigation
         recommended by the Panel. Instead, the Board asked the Panel "to undertake a
         review of the existing problems of the Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project in the areas
         of environment and resettlement and provide an assessment of the adequacy of the
         Action Plans as agreed between the Bank and the two countries within the next
         four months." The Board also decided that "independent of the above decision the
         Inspection Panel [was] expected to look at the extent to which the Bank staff had
         followed Bank procedures with respect to this project."112

76.      As the February 1997 Board decision referred only to "Bank procedures" (as
         opposed to Bank policies and procedures), and the Board did not clarify the
         precise extent and scope of its decision in spite of the Panel's request for
         clarification, the Panel did not look into possible violations of Bank policies and
         procedures. Rather, the Panel limited itself "to highlight the major areas where
         staff performance could or should have better followed" the Bank's operational
         statements.113 Without conducting an investigation of these particular matters, the
         Panel identified    "three main areas of concern," (a) participation of affected
         people, (b) supervision, and (c) institutional strengthening.114

2.4.5. The Panel Review and Assessment of the Action Plans

77.      In the following four months the Panel conducted the review the Board had asked
         for, returning to the Yacyretá project site twice (in May and July 1997). During

Assessment"].

                                                                                                  24

         the Panel's review, it received a number of additional Requests for Inspection
         concerning specific aspects of the Project's implementation.115 The Panel, after
         consulting with the Board, included in its report the issues raised by these
         additional requests, such as the replacement of housing on the Argentine side,
         quality of housing and community infrastructure on both sides of the reservoir,
         and the economic situation of fishermen, oleros, and workers in the brick-making
         industry. The Panel's Report, submitted to the Board in September 1997, was
         structured in four parts, including a review of the Yacyretá Project's problems, an
         assessment of the adequacy of the action plans presented by the Bank's
         Management, the additional Requests, and a summary review of the Bank's
         compliance with its procedures.116

78.      One of the fundamental problems of the Yacyretá Project identified by the Panel
         was the imbalance between the execution of civil and electromechanical work on
         the one hand and resettlement and environmental measures on the other.117 While
         at the time of the Panel's review the former measures were 99.8 percent complete,
         less than a third of the environmental and resettlement plans had been completed.
         This imbalance led to increasing social and environmental "liabilities" with
         mounting financial costs. The Panel considered this imbalance to be exacerbated
         by the Bank's usual practice of financing mostly civil works and leaving
         resettlement and environmental measures for counterpart funding and urged the
         Bank to reconsider this practice.118

79.      In terms of the delays, the Panel also noted that a number of issues raised in the
         Request could have been dealt with earlier in project execution and concluded:
         "The lack of participation of affected people and local authorities in project
         related activities and a tendency by Bank supervision missions to ignore or take
         lightly the concerns of area people may be at the root of these problems."119

80.      The Panel's review also revealed that the Yacyretá Project lacked sufficient
         financial resources for project completion.120       Project costs were initially
         estimated by the Bank's Staff Appraisal Report in 1979 to be US$3.7 billion,
         while the Panel's review, on the basis of figures provided by Bank Management,
         estimated that the costs would surpass US$8.5 billion, more than double of the
         initial estimated amount. The Panel also found that the expenses of effective
         mitigation measures had been underestimated significantly.           The project's
         financial difficulties increased in the mid-1990s, when--because of the Mexican
         Peso Crisis--the Government of Argentina, facing difficult macroeconomic
         conditions, decided to cut off and finally suspend all financial support for the
         Project and to seek private capital to complete and operate the facility.121

         However, in 1996 the legislation to privatize Yacyretá had failed to obtain
         approval in the congresses of both Argentina and Paraguay. As the Panel's report
         envisaged, this led to a complete paralysis of the Project's complementary works
         for almost two years.122

81.      Regarding socioeconomic impacts, the Panel found that thousands of residents,
         including fishermen and brick-makers, lost their jobs and sources of income as a
         result of the construction of the dam and that scores of those people had not
         received any kind of compensation. Moreover, the Panel found that less than 25
         percent of the people who would be affected by the dam had been resettled prior
         to the filling of the reservoir.123

82.      The Panel also assessed the adequacy of the Bank's action plans presented during
         the February Board meeting.124 Plan A intended to remedy actions that should
         have been carried out prior to filling the reservoir in 1994, with projected costs of
         up to US$16 million. This plan included expropriations, provision of a potable
         water supply to resettled populations, construction of urban and rural housing,
         indemnification of tile-makers, and issuance of property titles to resettled
         people.125

83.      In its review, the Panel highlighted the fact that not all of Plan A's envisioned
         commitments, such as hydro-geological studies, could be completed by the
         completion date of December 1997.126 The Bank's second action plan, "Plan B,"
         contained required complementary works needed to permit prolonged operation
         of the reservoir at 76 masl, all at a projected cost of US$117 million.127 The
         Panel's assessment revealed that Plan B dealt only with some of the existing
         problems; according to many people the Panel interviewed, the plan was "by no
         means" complete. The Panel noted, "The process of implementing the so-called
         "solutions" has not been adequate."128 The Panel's assessment also showed that
         major decisions had not been finalized regarding construction of wastewater
         treatment plants in Posadas and Encarnación, mitigation of the effects of the dam
         on fisheries, and provision of long-term supplies of clay to the regional industry.

84.      Concerning resettlement and environmental issues, the Panel's assessment found
         that the number of people to be involuntarily resettled--originally estimated to be
         50,000--had increased to at least 70,000 people.129 Among the difficulties in the
         entire process identified by the Panel were changes to the Bank's policy regarding
         resettlement standards, the project's weak programs of social communication, and
         the lack of adequate identification of vulnerable groups who required special

         assistance. In the Panel review, the Panel urged the Bank to include the inflow of
         people from new areas in any future plans.130

85.      As for environmental issues, the Panel identified the lack of institutional support
         in EBY and financial shortages as major reasons for the difficulties in
         implementing the environmental mitigation measures.131 The Panel also found
         the reserves and biodiversity programs to be deficient and the linkages between
         environmental and health effects to be not well established. The Panel concluded
         that "a long history of delays and noncompliance tolerated by the Bank does not
         allow the Panel to provide a realistic assessment of future Project performance
         with any degree of confidence."132

2.4.6. 1997 Amendment to the Bank Loan Agreements

86.      In 1997 the legal documents of Bank Loan No. 2854-AR and Loan No. 3520-AR
         were amended to include, inter alia, a detailed description of Plans A and B and
         the activities to be completed to raise the reservoir's water level to 78 masl.133 In
         addition, as amended, the legal agreements provide that raising the water level
         beyond 78 masl is subject to the completion of the social and environmental
         activities set forth in the Project's Environmental Management Plan (EMP). For
         the Bank to approve the filling of the reservoir above 78 masl, EBY needs to
         submit a satisfactory revision of the EMP containing a program to mitigate the
         environmental impact of, and to resettle the population to be affected by, such
         raising of the reservoir and to fully implement this revised EMP in a manner
         satisfactory to the Bank.134

87.      Finally, it should be noted that, according to the General Conditions Applicable to
         Bank Loans and Guarantee Agreements, the aforementioned obligations will be
         binding upon the Borrower until the principal amount, interest, and any other
         charges accrued on the loan are fully repaid.135

2.5. Factors Affecting the Project's Completion

88.      As Management states in the Response, "[a] great deal has transpired in the
         nearly thirty years since the launching of the project, including much that is
         positive. First, despite lengthy delays, the hydroelectric facility itself is well-

                                                                                                   27

          constructed and has been operated relatively efficiently, though only at two-thirds
          of capacity due to resettlement driven financial constraints to raising the
          reservoir to the final design level of 83 masl."136 This matter has been the subject
          of a long debate, and even the Panel's report on the adequacy of Plan A and B
          referred to it in 1997.137 At the time of the Panel's report, the privatization of the
          power generation facilities built under the project seemed to be a logical
          alternative to the parties concerned. However, the privatization option did not
          materialize, as the congresses of both Argentina and Paraguay did not approve it.
          Today, the completion of the project continues to face uncertainties.

89.       The decision to raise the reservoir above the current level of 76 masl, whether to
          78 masl, 80 masl or to the design level of 83 masl, will have important social,
          economic and environmental impacts on many of the Requesters as well as
          important financial implications.

90.       The raising of the reservoir has been the subject of extensive technical,
          economical, and financial analyses and the authorities have been working with
          several scenarios. These scenarios are based on different hypotheses, including
          different projections of internal (national) energy demand, external (international)
          energy demand, gas and electricity prices and alternative expansion plans for the
          energy sector. The Bank recently commissioned a study by a prominent
          Argentinean consulting firm that has not been endorsed by the Bank or by the
          governments of Argentina and Paraguay.138 The study shows that, to achieve the
          long-run marginal costs--expressed as the price at which investors may agree to
          build and operate an additional plant--the electricity sold by Yacyretá should
          reach prices that are substantially above the present price for electricity generated
          by hydropower plants set by Argentina.139 According to the study, as of June
          2002, under the formula provided by the Treaty, the price that Argentina needs to
          pay EBY is US$29.40/MWh.140

de Diferentes Elevaciones de Cotas de Yacyretá, Informe Final, Buenos Aires, October 2003 [hereinafter
"Mercados Energéticos Study"]. This study is unpublished.
139See Mercados Energéticos Study. According to the October 2003 Bank Supervision Mission's Back to
Office report, as of October 2003, GOA's Secretary of Energy had established through a resolution that the
price of electricity generated by hydropower plants is US$2/MWh. This has reduced substantially EBY's
annual operational income and created an annual shortfall of about US$50 million in the resources to cover
the project's operating and maintenance costs, figures that do not include any further investments.
Argentina may make up for this shortfall by issuing letters of credit.
140 Annex C of the Treaty, as modified by the Letter of Agreement dated August 30, 1979, discusses the
bases of financing and lending for electricity services. Annex C establishes a formula for calculating the
price per unit of electricity (in US$/kWh) and stipulates that this price, set initially in the year that the plant
begins service, will be maintained at a constant value in accordance with the formula set forth in Planilla 2
of the annex. See Annex C, Chapters IV and VI. In a subsequent letter of agreement, the two governments
set an initial price of electricity of US$ 0.30/kWh (US$30.00/MWh), at a constant value of December
1991. Letter of Agreement, "Tarifa y Financiamiento Proyecto Yacyretá," (January 9, 1992), Normas

91.      As shown in the table below, there is a direct correlation between the raising of
         the reservoir to different levels and the expected increases in the dam's generating
         capacity.

                           From 78 to 80                              +367
                           From 80 to 82                              +400
                           From 82 to 83                              +338
                           Total Increase                            +1,300

92.      The Panel has received evidence that the Bank maintains its position that the
         raising of the reservoir must be preceded by the mitigation and resettlement
         measures agreed upon between the Bank, the IDB, the governments of Argentina
         and Paraguay, and EBY.142 Presently, according to legal agreements in force, a
         number of social and environmental activities have yet to be completed in order to
         raise the water level beyond the current 76 masl, including:

         · Plan A, which requires completion of activities that were to be implemented
              before filling the reservoir up to 76 masl, is not yet complete because some
              titles to plots in the resettlement sites still need to be issued. The Panel
              understands that the delay in the issuance of these titles stems mainly from
              pending lawsuits related to entitlements, but it also notes that the solution to
              this problem may take considerable additional time.

         · Plan B provides for implementation of activities necessary to operate the
              reservoir at 76 masl for a prolonged period of time. It has not yet been
              completed. Some property titles remain to be issued. The relocation of the
              municipal slaughterhouse and the municipal market is almost completed, but
              these entities must be transferred from EBY to the municipality for operation
              and maintenance. In its Aide Memoire, related to the October 2003
              supervision mission, Management expressed concerns about the delay in
              transferring the infrastructure works to the local authorities, as this contributes
              to increasing project costs.143 This Aide Memoire states that the construction
              of the sewage system in Encarnación144 is expected to begin in early 2004. As
              of January 2004 this had not begun.

142Management Memorandum, May 6, 2003.
143Aide Memoire, October 23-30, 2003.
144There seem to be some conflicting interpretations about the content and extent of this obligation. Some
stakeholders told the Panel that this obligation was limited to the construction of the wastewater treatment
plant, while others expressed the view that the system also included all ancillary works, including sewage
collectors, interceptors, and the necessary works for house connections.


                                                                                                          29

        · To raise the water level up to 78 masl, all actions outlined in Plan A and Plan
             B must be completed. In addition, "all actions set forth in the EMP and all
             actions set forth in Schedule 2 to the project agreement" must be "completed
             in a manner satisfactory to the Bank."145 With respect to social activities,
             EBY must, inter alia, indemnify and transfer the population living in the areas
             between 76 and 78 masl, issue property titles, and implement rehabilitation
             programs in the new settlements, such as health programs and food assistance,
             if needed. To date, EBY has resettled all the people living at levels between
             76 and 78 masl, but a number of property titles have yet to be conveyed to
             entitled families. Environmental mitigation activities such as the sewage
             collection and treatment systems, including the construction of the wastewater
             treatment plant in Encarnación, have also not begun as noted above.

        · To raise the water level any higher than 78 masl, EBY has to complete a
             host of resettlement and environmental mitigation activities required for each
             meter of elevation plus its corresponding buffer zone. According to the Bank's
             Aide Memoire of October 2003, in Paraguay "around 600 families out of the
             remaining 2,110 are located in levels 78 and 80."146 Current data show that a
             total of 5,108 urban families must be relocated in order to complete the
             project, 2,078 (38 percent) of which have already been resettled and 1,249 of
             which are "planned to be relocated in the next years, thus achieving a
             progress of 61% [of people relocated]."147

        In the Bank's Aide Memoire, however, Management clarifies that these data are
        based on the 2000 survey/verification and that "there are no estimations
        regarding the population that has settled in the area required for the projects in
        the last years."148 The Aide Memoire also notes that the above "data are not
        completely consistent with the information previously submitted to the Bank" and
        that the Bank has provided EBY with a chart format so that EBY follows unified
        criteria when providing information about both river banks.149                       The mission
        reported that "[a] significant number of new dwellings and olerias [brick maker
        facilities] below inundation levels were observed" during a visit to the
        municipality of Carmen del Paraná and that, in Encarnación, "no progress has
        been made regarding the relocation of the commercial area, which includes more
        than 300 plots and 700 stores."150 The commercial area is located above the 80-
        masl level. A new market building, however, has been constructed above the
        affected area, with the access road and parking spaces still to be completed as of
        December 2003.151             At the higher reservoir levels, a system to monitor

147The data refers to Paraguay. According to EBY, in Argentina a total of 6,668 urban families need to be
relocated. 70 percent have already been resettled, while 1,218 are scheduled to relocate in 2004, thus
reaching 87.6 percent of relocations. 500 of these families are located between 78 and 84 masl.

           underground water in Encarnación and Posadas will also be essential for urban
           environmental management.152 All of these measures represent a very substantial
           undertaking.

93.        Management provided the Panel with the most recent estimates of the investment
           costs to raise the level of the reservoir.153 These estimates, which have not been
           independently verified by the Bank, are contained in the Strategic Plan prepared
           by EBY in July 2002.154 As shown in Table I-2 below, EBY needs: (i) US$282
           million to raise the level to 78 masl, (ii) an additional US$298 to reach 80 masl,
           and (iii) an additional US$134 million to raise the level of the reservoir to its final
           level (83 masl). This total of US$714 million would include the investment costs
           for expropriations, civil works, and environmental and social programs required
           to raise the reservoir level to the different masl levels, as well as associated
           contingency and supervision costs.155

94.        In addition to these investment costs, however, the Treaty of Yacyretá calls for
           about US$200 million in additional works to be carried out after the reservoir is
           raised to its final level, including investments for a railroad, port, and
           complementary coastal works in Argentina, as well as a railroad and an
           international airport in Encarnación, Paraguay.156 As a result, the total estimated
           cost to complete the project, in July 2002 prices, was US$914 million.

95.        According to Management, EBY is currently revising and updating its investment
           cost calculations and plans to submit, by March 30, 2004, to both the Argentine
           and Paraguayan Governments an updated investment plan for raising the reservoir
           level to 83 masl. These updated calculations will be the basis for the
           governments'        up-coming       discussions     and     could      include      revisions      or
           postponements of certain items (such as the additional works referred to above).
           That would result in savings of about 10 to 15 percent of present estimates.157

156 It should be noted that, although these works are not technically directly linked to raising the reservoir to
its final level, they are required by the Treaty of Yacyretá.
157 Management notes that, for example, some recent bids for selected civil works (including the Aguapey
Channel and the sewerage system and wastewater treatment plant in Encarnación) have been lower than
previously estimated.

          96.       Despite planned investments, there is no consensus among stakeholders on
                    whether in the foreseeable future there will be sufficient market demand for
                    electricity at price levels that would justify the investment cost necessary to
                    increase Yacyretá's generation capacity.                 This situation poses a number of
                    questions and requires several key decisions from the governments of Argentina
                    and Paraguay. The cost of raising the reservoir, including, inter alia, the cost of
                    the social and environmental commitments of both governments with the Bank
                    and other co-financiers, may not be justified at this time on financial grounds
                    alone. However, one political justification may be that the expansion of the
                    generating capacity of Yacyretá could be used by both governments both as a
                    reliable source of electricity supply and, perhaps, as a price control instrument.

          97.       The Panel finds that the long delays that have already occurred in
                    implementing the resettlement and environmental mitigation activities have
                    brought substantial costs and serious hardships to the affected populations.
                    The Panel further notes the need for a decision to define the final operating
                    level of the reservoir. The Panel wishes to highlight the economic and social
                    costs associated with any decision regarding the level of the reservoir if it is
                    not politically or otherwise feasible to implement the decision fully and in a



                                                                                                                32

      timely manner. The governments' decision as to whether, how much and
      when to raise the operating level of the reservoir will direct affect the ability
      of the Bank to bring this project into compliance with its operational policies
      and procedures.


3. APPLICABILITY OF THE BANK OPERATIONAL POLICIES TO THE YACYRETÁ PROJECT

98.   The complex chronology of events of the Yacyretá Project, as outlined in this
      section, shows that the history of this Project starts long before any Bank
      involvement.      However, since the late seventies the Bank has financially
      committed to Yacyretá through five loans--Loan 1761-AR approved in 1979;
      Loan 2998-AR approved in 1989; Loan 3520-AR approved in 1992; Loan 2854-
      AR approved in 1987 and reallocated to Yacyretá in 1994; and Loan 3842-PA.

99.   The first loans financing the Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project were approved before
      the Bank's relevant safeguard policies came into force. OD 4.00 Annex B on
      Environmental Policy for Dams and Reservoirs entered into effect in 1989, and
      OD 4.01 on Environmental Assessment took effect in October 1991. The location
      of the civil works, the height of the embankments, the extent of ultimate
      inundation, and the environmental and social consequences of these actions were
      thus not subject to formal environmental assessments early in the project cycle.
      Neither was there formal consideration and evaluation of realistic project
      alternatives; formal assessment and prediction of the likely effects of project
      actions; independent review of environmental impact statements; nor public
      disclosure of the results of environmental assessments. Similarly, as OD 4.30 on
      Involuntary Resettlement took effect in June 1990, its provisions do not apply to
      the first resettlement plan, which was approved in 1979.

100.  By contrast, Loan 3520-AR to finance the so-called Second Yacyretá
      Hydroelectric Project was approved in 1992 and is therefore subject to OD 4.01
      on Environmental Assessment and OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement.
      Consistent with these directives, before approving the loan, the Bank requested
      the preparation of an Environmental Assessment and a Resettlement and
      Rehabilitation Plan as part of the conditionality for this loan. The resettlement
      plan, prepared by the Borrower and reviewed by the Bank in 1992, remains the
      operative plan for the resettlement operations still being carried out under the
      Yacyretá Project.

101.  Loan 3842-PA, which finances the Paraguayan Reform Project for the Water and
      Telecommunications Sector, formerly the Asunción Sewerage Project, is also
      subject to the full range of the Bank policies mentioned above, as it was approved
      in 1995.

102.  Loan 2854-AR (SEGBA V project) was approved in 1989, before the Bank's
      safeguard policies came into force. However, at the time the loan was changed to
      allow funds to be applied to the Yacyretá project, OD 4.01, OD 4.30 and other



                                                                                     33

     safeguards policies were already applicable to this project and the use of funds
     from this loan did not change the policy framework for the project vis-à-vis the
     Bank.

103. More specifically, the policies that are applicable to the Yacyretá Project for the
     purpose of the Panel's investigation are:

        · Environmental Assessment OD 4.01 (October 1991)
        · Involuntary Resettlement OD 4.30 (June 1990)
        · Project Supervision OD/OP/BP 13.05 (March 1989 and July 2001)
        · Monitoring and Evaluation OD 10.70 (November 1989)




                                                                                     34

                               4. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT


104.    The Request for Inspection contends that the Yacyretá project has caused harm to
        the local people and the environment due to an inadequate analysis of the
        project's social and environmental impacts.            In the Requesters' view, faulty
        identification and assessment of the project impacts have led to the exclusion of
        thousands of people from the compensation and mitigation programs that they
        would otherwise be entitled to, and have caused environmental contamination,
        flooding, and unsafe health conditions.

105.    The Panel notes that the Requesters' claim introduces the issue of the adequacy of
        the Yacyretá project's environmental assessment (EA), prepared under the
        guidance of the Bank in 1992. While the Requesters indicate it as the root of their
        concerns, the Management Response does not address the adequacy of the
        project's environmental impact studies. Management focuses instead on specific
        subjects, such as "the quality of water in the reservoir," "health conditions in the
        reservoir's area of influence158," and the urban creeks' flooding events.

106.    The detailed Management Response regarding these specific issues is analyzed in
        the relevant sections of this Report.159 In general, however, Management asserts
        that "it has carried out its obligations in accordance with its relevant policies and
        procedures,"160 and that "many of the matters raised by the Requesters are not
        attributable to the project, but are related to situations which existed before the
        project began."161

107.    Consistent with the Panel's mandate--to respond to complaints by individuals
        who believe that they have been harmed by a Bank-financed project because the
        Bank has not followed its policies and procedure--this section analyzes the
        environmental assessment, which the Bank approved and reviewed, in the light of
        the relevant applicable Bank policy, OD 4.01 on Environmental Assessment. The
        Borrower prepared the EA162 in the preparation stage of the so-called Second
        Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project and in 1992 submitted it to the Bank for its
        review, as required by OD 4.01.163

108.    The policy on Environmental Assessment outlines the Bank standards for
        procedures and content of environmental assessments and of related types of
        environmental analysis. The Policy states that the "EA is a flexible procedure,
        which should vary in breadth, depth, and type of analysis depending on the

         project."164 OD 4.01 adds that "[t]he purpose of [the] EA is...to ensure that the
         project options under consideration are environmentally sound and sustainable"
         and requires that "[a]ll environmental consequences should be recognized early
         in the project cycle...."165 It follows that the nature of an EA is to "identify ways
         of improving projects environmentally, by preventing, minimizing, mitigating, or
         compensating for adverse impacts."166 In addition, OD 4.01 goes beyond stating
         policy that must be observed and specifies the details of the procedures, which
         must be implemented. The paragraphs below present the Panel's analysis of these
         aspects.

4.1. Environmental Screening

109.     Screening for Environmental Assessment is required by paragraph 17 of OD 4.01
         "to decide the nature and extent of the EA or environmental analysis to be carried
         out." Screening assigns a project to one of three categories:
             Category A: A full environmental assessment is required.
             Category B: Environmental analysis is required but not a full environmental
                           Assessment.
             Category C: No environmental assessment or environmental analysis is
                           required.

110.     Phase two of the Yacyretá Project was assigned category A by the Bank167 and
         category IV by the Inter-American Development Bank.168                     The Asunción
         Sewerage Project (later renamed the Reform Project for the Water and
         Telecommunications Sectors) was also assigned category A by the Bank.169 Both
         projects thus require full environmental impact assessment as envisaged by OD
         4.01. The Panel finds that the environmental screening process for phase two
         of the Yacyretá Project and for the Asunción Sewerage Project was
         appropriate.

4.2. Preparation of Environmental Assessments

111.     OD 4.01 requires that Environmental Assessment take place during project
         preparation so that all environmental consequences are recognized early in the
         project cycle.170

4.2.1. The First Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project

112.     It is clear that `the project cycle' was already far advanced by the time OD 4.00
         Annex B (Environmental Policy for Dam and Reservoir Projects) and OD 4.01
         (Environmental Assessment) took effect so that these provisions cannot be
         applied to the First Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project. The Project documents,
         however,       require   "the Governments of Argentina and Paraguay and
         YACYRETÁ...to carry out an environmental program acceptable to the Bank to
         minimize the environmental impact of the project"171 and to "carry out the
         resettlement component according to programs and timetables satisfactory to the
         Bank.172"

4.2.2. The Second Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project

113.     When the Second Yacyretá Project was placed before the Bank in 1992, a formal
         environmental assessment had been undertaken.173 This was accompanied by an
         Environmental Management Plan (EMP or PMMA)174 as well as an Action Plan
         for Resettlement and Rehabilitation (RRAP or PARR).175 The Panel finds that
         Management thus met the requirement of OD 4.01 at that time.

4.2.3. The Water and Telecommunications Reform Project and SEGBA V Power
Distribution Project

114.     The Asunción Sewerage Project focused on providing improved sewerage
         services for Asunción.176 However, the project also included the provision of
         infrastructure for a resettlement site, Itá Paso, in Encarnación177. In 1994 the
         Bank agreed that US$135 million of undisbursed funds from the SEGBA V
         Power Distribution Project to Argentina (Loan No. 2854-AR) could be reallocated
         to the Yacyretá Project for environmental protection and social aspects.178 Funds
         from the two loans were to be used to fund resettlement sites in Encarnación with
         water supply and sewage disposal facilities, roads, storm water drainage, solid
         waste disposal facilities, and power distribution.                These activities on the
         resettlement sites clearly needed an environmental assessment that would identify
         impacts at the resettlement site and on surrounding communities. While the
         Asunción Sewerage Project had an environmental assessment, it was for the
         sewerage system in Asunción179. Similarly the SEGBA V Power Distribution

        Project to Argentina did not have an environmental assessment that covered these
        activities in Encarnación.

115.    During most of its research period for this investigation the Panel found that the
        Bank could not locate any environmental assessment of the impacts that would
        result from providing resettlement sites in Encarnación with water supply and
        sewage disposal facilities and the infrastructure noted above. Interviews with staff
        did not reveal such an assessment. In November 2003, after repeated calls for all
        relevant documents, Management provided the Panel                          with     copies  of
        environmental assessments undertaken by various consultants to EBY. The
        studies relate to the resettlement sites of Itá Paso, Arroyo Porá, and Carmen del
        Paraná. The Panel also received a General Summary of a Resettlement and
        Rehabilitation Action Plan for the Urban Creeks Program.180 In a memo of
        January 14, 2003, Management indicated that the Bank had ensured that EBY's
        "capacity to apply those [environmental] criteria and procedures was sufficient,"
        which implies that the EBY consultants who prepared the environmental
        assessments had the requisite capability to do so.

116.    The Panel has reviewed the environmental assessments and finds that they
        are very inadequate. They do not comply with the requirements of OD 4.01.
        The range of environmental matters addressed is limited; affected parties
        were not consulted; and no mitigation measures are suggested. As discussed
        later, no alternative resettlement sites were considered. The safeguard
        envisioned to be in place through OD 4.01 has therefore failed.

117.    The Panel notes that if the Bank did not require environmental assessments for the
        provision of infrastructure in Encarnación, as it appeared to the Panel throughout
        its research, Management did not comply with OD 4.01. If the assessments,
        which were prepared by EBY consultants are intended to constitute the required
        assessments, as Management now contends, they are highly inadequate. Thus,
        the Panel finds that Management is not in compliance with OD 4.01 with respect
        to the Encarnación portion of Loan 3842-PA and Loan 2854 - AR.

4.3. Consideration of Alternatives

118.    If there is no alternative, there can be no choice.             This basic principle was
        recognized in environmental assessment more than three decades ago.181 The
        purpose of environmental assessment is to improve decisions by making

         appropriate choices. It follows that careful comparison of realistic alternatives is
         an important feature of environmental assessments. Without systematic
         consideration of realistic alternatives, any environmental assessment is seriously
         flawed.

119.     The Bank's directives clearly recognize the need to consider alternatives.
         Paragraph 4c of OD 4.01 of October 1991 states that project specific EA's should
         normally cover: "systematic environmental comparison of alternative investments,
         sites, technologies and designs." This is amplified in paragraph (f) of Annex B of
         OD 4.01:

             "The EA report should include the following items:
             (f) Analysis of alternatives. Systematic comparison of the proposed
             investment design, site, technology and operational alternatives in terms
             of their potential environmental impacts.... For each of the alternatives,
             the environmental costs and benefits should be quantified to the extent
             possible, and economic values should be attached where feasible. The
             basis for the selection of the alternative proposed for the project design
             must be stated."182

120.     To ensure that the importance of alternatives is fully understood, Task 5 of the
         Bank's Sample Terms of Reference (TOR) for Environmental Assessment states
         as follows:

             "Task 5. Analysis of Alternatives to the Proposed Project. Describe
             alternatives that were examined in the course of developing the
             proposed project and identify other alternatives, which would achieve
             the same objectives.          The concept of alternatives extends to siting,
             design, technology selection, construction techniques and phasing, and
             operating and maintenance procedures. Compare alternatives in terms
             of potential environmental impacts; capital and operating costs;
             suitability under local conditions; and institutional, training, and
             monitoring requirements. When describing the impacts, indicate which
             are irreversible or unavoidable and which can be mitigated. To the
             extent possible, quantify the costs and benefits of each alternative,
             incorporating the estimated costs of any associated mitigating measures.
             Include the alternative of not constructing the project, in order to
             demonstrate environmental conditions without it."


121.     The Bank's policies and directives leave no room for doubt as to the need for a
         careful and systematic consideration of different types of alternatives, including
         investment alternatives, alternative sites, alternative project designs, and
         alternative implementation plans.



182Paragraph 2 of OP 4.01 of January 1999 expands on the earlier directive: "EA evaluates a project's
potential environmental risks and impacts in its area of influence; examines project alternatives; identifies
ways of improving project selection, siting, planning, design, and implementation ..."


                                                                                                           41

4.3.1. Alternatives in First Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project

122.     No systematic analysis of alternatives--locations, technical designs, or modes of
         implementation--is available or appears to have been made. However, the First
         Yacyretá hydroelectric project was not subject to OD 4.01, on Environmental
         Assessment.

4.3.2. Alternatives in Second Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project

123.     With Bank funds, EBY commissioned an environmental assessment in late 1991.
         The designated consultants completed an Environmental Report of the Yacyretá
         Project in January 1992. This document served as the basis for the development
         of the Environmental Management Plan (PMMA) and the Action Plan for
         Resettlement and Rehabilitation (PARR). These documents were circulated at a
         workshop amongst some 90 participants representing 40 institutions and NGOs in
         Ayolas, Paraguay in July 1992. Modifications to the PMMA and the PARR were
         made as a result of the workshop. EBY directors approved these documents in
         December 1992.

124.     From these documents an "Environmental Summary" titled "Environment and
         Resettlement in Yacyretá" was produced and approved in February 1993. The
         purpose of the document was to consolidate the PARR and PMMA as integral
         parts of the Yacyretá project so as to ensure that environmental and social
         safeguards were observed in project implementation. The document thus serves
         more as a background for the preparation of environmental management plans
         than as an evaluation.

125.     The EA for the Second Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project contains a section titled
         "Analysis of Alternatives."183 Here the fact that the dam is in an advanced stage
         of construction at a site that holds many environmental disadvantages is stated, as
         is the limited opportunity for environmental considerations to influence dam
         design. The alternatives available for consideration were a) permanent operation
         of the Yacyretá reservoir at a level lower than 83 masl and b) completion of the
         project without the Arroyo Aguapey barrage. The subsequent analysis concluded
         that:

             "Permanent operation of the Yacyretá reservoir at a lower level (such as
             76 or 78) would significantly reduce environmental costs."184

             "The alternative of completing the Yacyretá Project (with operation at
             EL 83) without the planned Arroyo Aguapey barrage would be
             environmentally much less desirable (although it might well be desirable
             from a strictly economic standpoint).           Without the planned
             barrage...(very roughly) 40,000 ha of natural grasslands, wetlands, and
             riverine forests, ...lost to the Yacyretá Project.... One endangered

              species of bird... occurs in the area that would be flooded.... An
              additional 1,000 rural people would need to be resettled if the barrage
              were not built."185

126.     Apart from this analysis of operational levels and the Arroyo Aguapey barrage,
         the document is an analysis of the likely consequences that would follow from
         implementing the Yacyretá project. The history of the Yacyretá development
         makes it understandable why the document does not examine the full suite of
         possible project alternatives. Realistic alternatives are nevertheless considered.
         With respect to the consideration of alternatives under the Second Yacyretá
         Hydroelectric Project the environmental assessment is in compliance with
         OD 4.01.

4.3.3. Alternatives in Resettlement: Water and Telecommunications Reform Project
and SEGBA V Power Distribution Project.

127.     As noted above, after repeated requests for documentation, Management provided
         the Panel with copies of documents that were proffered as environmental
         assessments for some of the resettlement sites associated with the project.186 The
         studies, which were undertaken by various consultants to EBY, relate to the
         resettlement sites of Itá Paso, Arroyo Porá, and Carmen del Paraná. The Panel
         also received a General Summary of a Resettlement and Rehabilitation Action
         Plan conducted in terms of the Urban Creeks Program.187

128.     The Panel finds that these documents do not consider alternative
         resettlement sites as required by OD 4.01. The failure to consider alternative
         sites for the resettlement developments in the vicinity of Encarnación has meant
         that locations have been selected that are sub-optimal in terms of soil types,
         drainage, proximity to existing infrastructure, and distance to places of
         employment.

4.4. Consideration of Biophysical Environment

4.4.1. The Second Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project

129.     The environmental assessment for the Second Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project
         discussed the following biophysical parameters:

         Impact on flora and fauna188
         Impact on water resources189

130.     The Environmental Management (PMMA) developed to address the concerns and
         forecasts made in the environmental assessment aimed to "...prevent, mitigate
         and offset damage to ecosystems, human populations and services infrastructure
         from construction and operations connected with the Yacyretá hydroelectric
         project, and to protect areas of high ecological and cultural value in the project's
         impact area."201 Apart from "human populations," these objectives have been
         achieved to a remarkable degree. This has been done through a combination of
         supervision, monitoring, research, institutional strengthening, institutional
         coordination, involvement of affected parties, use of outside expertise, and regular
         program evaluation.

131.     The Panel interviewed Bank officials responsible for project environmental
         management.202         While conducting Panel members on site visits, EBY
         environmental staff also explained the activities in which they were involved.203
         The Panel's consultants reviewed the complete series of PMMAs for the project
         available in the Bank's collection of Yacyretá documentation. In addition, the
         Independent Review204 of the PMMAs undertaken for the Bank and EBY were
         carefully studied, with the translation from the Spanish conducted by a consultant
         fluent in Spanish.205 The independent reviewer's comments with respect to the

                                                                                                    44

         technical work in ecosystem management, and the model technical capacity of the
         public health monitoring were noted. So too were the reviewer's comments on
         the desirability of a regional approach to water quality monitoring and the need
         for monitoring that would provide evidence of cause and allow preventive action
         to be undertaken. The reviewer also noted the successful establishment of nature
         reserves, the incorporation of NGOs into their management, and the increased
         cooperation of local people with reserve policies. The Panel's observations made
         during its field visit to the reserve areas are consistent with these findings.

132.     From the documentation studied, the independent review of the PMMA, the
         interviews with Bank and EBY staff, and personal observations, the Panel
         observes that the biophysical environment affected by the Yacyretá dam and
         reservoir is being managed competently and that the initial problems that
         arose when the reservoir was first filled have been satisfactorily resolved.
         The early problems of floating mats of vegetation, proliferation of aquatic weeds,
         gas super-saturation downstream from spillways, inadequate water supply to the
         Aña Cua, illegal fishing, and poaching in nature reserves have all been
         satisfactorily addressed and are no longer deemed to be significant problems. The
         ongoing attention that Bank staff have paid to these issues during supervisory
         missions is well documented in supervisory mission reports and back-to-office
         memoranda.206

133.     The Panel is, however, seriously concerned that the present sound environmental
         management practices207 will deteriorate, because EBY has to reduce the level of
         funding needed to maintain them. Both Bank staff and NGOs alerted the Panel to
         this possibility.    The reserves established to ensure biodiversity conservation
         would become vulnerable should the level of funding provided for their support
         decrease. Similarly, concern was expressed that the present level of control over
         fishing could not be maintained if the support given by the Paraguayan Navy were
         to be withdrawn. Bank staff responsible for environmental oversight of the
         Yacyretá project informed the Panel of their concern that the mechanism for the
         recovery of costs for environmental management, although in place, is
         inadequate. Examples were cited of payments for monitoring contracts being
         long delayed and of staff action being required for payments to be effected. The
         supervision mission reports mention difficulties due to delays by EBY in
         disbursements to organizations providing environmental monitoring services.208
         The view was expressed that without ongoing Bank supervision, the money
         required for protected area maintenance, fishery control, and environmental
         monitoring would not be forthcoming.209



206The matters addressed in supervisory missions since 1997 are summarized in Annex B of Management
Response.
207These include reservoir operation, gas super-saturation management, water quality and dis ease vector
monitoring, nature reserve maintenance, and fisheries management.

                                                                                                       45

134.      The Panel's concern about funding has been increased by the October 2003 Bank
          Supervisory Mission Report,210 which outlines the critical financial position of the
          Yacyretá project. "The critical condition of the project financing is jeopardizing
          the continuity of project execution. Annual projections indicate that Yacyretá's
          annual income will be reduced to approximately US$23 to 35 million. This figure
          is much below the project operation and maintenance costs that in 2002
          amounted to US$ 49 million. Under these conditions there will be a deficit to
          cover the compensation payments to Paraguay... the salaries of EBY's employees,
          payments to consultants, the cost of the dam's insurance, and other operational
          costs that will not be covered by revenues from power sales."211

135.      The Panel finds that the future environmental management of the Yacyretá
          project is critically threatened by the Project's financial position and that
          both the natural environment and project-affected people will suffer
          additional harm if the Project's environmental management practices
          deteriorate.

4.4.2. The Water and Telecommunications Reform Project and the SEGBA V Power
Distribution Project

136.      The problems pertaining to environmental assessments for these projects have
          already been covered.212 Because the resettlement locations appear to have been
          located almost entirely on sites that have been subject to human use, no
          irrevocable loss of biodiversity is likely to have been occasioned by the
          resettlements. In terms of water resources, however, field observation showed
          that resettlement sites have been developed with apparent disregard for drainage
          lines and wetlands. The suitability of soils and terrain for low-cost resettlement
          also appears not to have been assessed.

4.5. Consideration of Urban and Peri-urban Environments

137.      The social component of EBY (and most of the social studies in the project) is
          focused entirely on resettlement and compensation, in an effort to meet the
          requirements of OD 4.30 (Involuntary Resettlement).213                            The "induced
          development and other socio-cultural aspects" of the Project, consideration of
          which is required by OD 4.01 on Environmental Assessment, were largely

212See § 4.2.3.
213Even in examining the administrative chart of EBY, provided to the Panel in January 2003, it appears
that all social science work is concentrated in the so-called "Resettlement Sector" of the Department of
Complementary Works. While recognizing that staff of any named office can have multiple duties, the
name itself leads us to the same conclusion as does an observation of the project's history: that the
Project's social science seems entirely dedicated to arranging for resettlement rather than to the broader
assessment of the project's social impact required by the Bank's operational directives.


                                                                                                          46

         neglected in the EA.214 For example, there was inadequate consideration of
         population growth and changes in the urban and peri-urban population density
         along with increased demands on the urban infrastructure of Encarnación. No
         consideration was given to the fate of the large number of workers attracted to the
         project at Ayolas, who continue to live in EBY-built housing there amid
         extremely high unemployment, after the primary hydrological works have been
         completed.

138.     Questioned as to an apparent lack of urban planning for resettlement in
         Encarnación, a former staff member told the Panel215 that, although the Yacyretá
         project had always had an urban component, Encarnación had grown beyond all
         expectations during the time the project has been underway and that the urban
         impact had been increased due to project delays, the regional economic recession,
         and a transfer of responsibility for urban areas from national to local
         governments.

139.     With respect to the Second Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project, Section F of the
         document Environment and Resettlement in Yacyretá:                            Environmental
         Summary216 briefly addressed the urban and peri-urban environment affected by
         the Yacyretá Project. The analysis was, however, focused mainly on the numbers
         of affected persons and the loss of economic opportunities. The structure and
         balance of the 1992 environmental assessment indicated that at that time the
         Yacyretá Project was deemed to have consequences mainly of an ecological
         nature, with social components related to a loss of access to clay by brick- and
         tile-makers.

140.     That the Project would give rise to significant urban resettlement complexities
         appears not to have been appreciated. A Bank staff member indicated to the
         Panel that while ideally, in the modern concept of environmental assessments, one
         would look at these kinds of issues, the broader development context of the city
         probably was not considered at the time the EA was done.                  217  Another staff
         member confirmed to the Panel218 that for Encarnación there had been no forward
         planning, no consideration of the effects of resettlement sites on transport routes
         or on land use. The land had already been selected. There was no analysis of
         alternative sites.

141.     In short, urban and peri-urban environmental concerns have not been considered
         at all for Encarnación. No environmental assessment was made of the impacts
         that would result from either selection of sites for potential resettlement or
         providing resettlement sites in Encarnación with water supply and sewerage

have been met either by including them in the Environmental Impact Assessment or within a separate
Social Assessment.

        disposal facilities, roads, storm water drainage, solid waste disposal facilities, or
        power distribution.

142.    The Panel finds that in the EA for the Second Yacyretá Project there was
        inadequate consideration of population growth and the effects this would
        have on Encarnación. The Panel also finds that Management did not ensure
        that EBY considered the effects that the resettlement developments would
        have on Encarnación and its infrastructure.

143.    OD 4.01 requires that the Bank assist in the study of environmental effects of
        "induced development" within environmental impact assessments:
            "Secondary growth of settlements and infrastructure, often referred to as
            `induced development' or `boomtown' effects, can have major indirect
            environmental impacts, which relatively weak local governments may
            have difficulty addressing."219

144.    The Panel finds that environmental and social assessments should have
        anticipated the induced effects associated with the Yacyretá project. This
        analysis would also include development consideration of the multiplier effects of
        impacts caused by the construction of the dam and reservoir and a study of the
        additional loads on the sewage system, roads, and resettlement sites with all their
        infrastructure and resulting likely population increases. This includes effects on
        villages above the level of flooding associated with movements of population,
        including effects on their economies and livelihoods of their people.

4.5.1. Layout and Logistics of Resettlement Townships and Villages

145.    Affected persons who addressed the Panel in Encarnación220 complained that
        available sites suitable for resettlement closer to the city center had not been
        considered and, as a consequence, they were having to endure the extra expense
        of transport to and from the city and their places of work. In the Panel's meeting
        with Cambyreta Municipal Authorities,221 local authorities complained that the
        sites within their municipal area chosen for the Yacyretá project resettlement were
        not suitable for the purpose and that no approval for their development had been
        granted by the municipality. They stated further that the sites had been planned
        without those responsible ever having visited the locations for site inspections.
        One official stated: "The entire planning situation in Encarnación is crazy."222

146.    In contrast to these views, at a Panel meeting with EBY staff223 the Panel was told
        that an environmental master plan for the City of Encarnación had been prepared
        in 1999, that this plan had been approved by the Encarnación municipality, and

        that it was the basis for resettlement planning. The Panel was unable to view this
        plan, although it was provided with a 1999 Environmental Management Plan for
        Encarnación.224        The Environmental Management Plan deals with some
        anticipated problems associated with raising the reservoir level to 83 masl, but it
        does not discuss the advantages and disadvantages of possible alternative
        resettlement sites nor the effects the new developments would have on city
        structure, land-use patterns, or transport routes.

147.    The safeguard envisaged under OD 4.01 to ensure informed planning that would
        not be to the detriment of the environment or affected communities has not
        worked in the case of resettlements due to the Yacyretá Project. The Panel finds
        that the environmental assessment of resettlement sites that was undertaken
        for the Second Yacyretá Project failed to give due regard to possible
        alternative sites and the effects that the new developments would have on the
        infrastructure of Encarnación. The Panel notes, however, that in the context
        of the PDA, Management advised EBY to co-ordinate resettlement in urban
        development plans.225

4.5.2. Roads and Road Networks

148.    No environmental assessment of the effects that the Yacyretá reservoir would
        have on the road network of Encarnación at various levels of inundation has been
        undertaken. An engineer from the Encarnación municipality confirmed this to the
        Panel.226 The Panel was told that EBY's plans for roads and bridges at an 83 masl
        reservoir level took little account of traffic flows and loads. The routes of the new
        roads had been highly influenced by such considerations as which local authority
        would benefit from road tolls and had given little consideration to how major new
        roads would shape the city. Neither Cambyreta municipal officials nor local
        NGOs had been consulted with respect to route selection, bridge placements, and
        road alignments.

149.    During site inspections, the Panel observed the construction of a new bridge
        across the M'boi Caé that is proceeding without any regard to environmentally
        and ecologically inappropriate placement of a supporting pillar directly in the
        main channel of the stream. The lack of application of sound environmental
        planning was self-evident.        The Panel is concerned that Bank Management
        approved a design of this nature.

      Figure 2 Arroyo Porá Resettlement Site: Poor Quality of Road Construction and Design



150.     During site inspections of resettlement locations close to Encarnación, the
         Requesters took the Panel to numerous sites at which roads were in a very bad
         state of disrepair. Most frequently the basalt paving cobbles had sunk due to the
         erosion of the sand foundation and clay packing, apparently by large volumes of
         storm water flowing on the road, since there was no provision for storm water
         drainage other than on the road.

151.     Leading a site inspection, the Cambyreta Municipal Engineer showed the Panel
         examples of clearly inappropriate road and drainage design.227              Roads in the
         course of construction had a sand bed of less than 0.15 m and newly packed
         cobbles could easily be lifted by hand. No provision was being made for storm
         water runoff despite the frequency of intense storms that characterize the region.
         (Rainfall statistics indicate that falls of over 100 mm in 24 hours occur
         routinely.228) Drainage channels from resettlement areas were inappropriately
         designed. In one instance, the stone-lined channel terminated abruptly high up on
         a slope, giving rise to a significant erosion gully below the emission point. In
         another, a lined channel about one square meter in section was directed straight
         down the slope for some 50 meters before making a right-angled turn to flow
         under a road via a culvert that had a cross-section significantly smaller than the
         channel leading to it. The consequence of the latter was flooding of properties
         and houses at considerable remove from the resettlement site itself.

        Figure 3 Arroyo Porá Resettlement Site: Inappropriate Design of Drainage Channel


152.   The Panel finds that there are many examples of inappropriate road and
       drainage design in the proposed resettlement areas, which could have been
       avoided through proper environmental assessments and stronger Bank
       supervision.      The problems with Bank oversight of the construction of
       housing and civil works are discussed in more detail in chapter four.


4.5.3. Water Supply, Sewerage and Sanitation, Urban Drainage
153.   Despite formal recognition of the fact that Encarnación needs to be provided with
       a piped sewerage system ahead of any increase in the operating height of the
       Yacyretá reservoir beyond 76 masl,229 no environmental assessment has been
       undertaken for this development.

154.     Further, despite regular flooding of the urban arroyos and the institution of the
         Programa de Desborde de Arroyos (PDA)-"Urban Creeks Program" in 1998, the
         documents provided and/or found by the Panel do not appear to constitute a
         formal environmental assessment for the program.230 Similarly, the extent to
         which the problem of the flooding of urban creeks is related to increased
         urbanization and densification in Encarnación has not been anticipated or studied.

155.     Although an analysis of the cause of the apparently exacerbated flooding of the
         urban creeks will not solve the problem, it would contribute directly to proper
         apportionment of responsibility for addressing the problem.                      At present the
         flooding of the urban creeks is assumed by NGOs and the Encarnación municipal
         officials to be a consequence of the flooding of the Yacyretá reservoir, so they are
         looking to EBY or the Bank for redress. Bank officials are, however, of the
         opinion that the flooding of the urban creeks is unrelated to the Yacyretá
         inundation to 76 masl.231 The absence of a definitive analysis of the problem has
         led to delays in its resolution and to the suffering of the affected persons being
         considerably prolonged.

156.     Among other shortcomings, the Panel finds that there was no evaluation of
         the consequences of the provision of reticulated water and sewerage facilities
         to resettlement sites in Encarnación, nor was there provision for either
         drainage to accommodate the discharge or adequate storm water drainage.

157.     The Panel finds that the safeguards to assess the implications for water
         supply, sewers, and urban drainage, which ought to have been in place via
         OD 4.01, were by-passed.              Management is not in compliance with the
         requirement of OD 4.01.

4.5.4. Implications of Non-Compliance with Environmental Safeguard Policies

158.     The failure to conduct a proper environmental assessment leads to a failure to
         identify and evaluate unintended consequences. For example, the lack of analysis
         of the consequences of developing new resettlement sites near Encarnación has
         resulted in ad hoc approaches to solving the consequent problems of water
         supply, sewerage disposal facilities, roads, storm water drainage, solid waste
         disposal, and power distribution, all of which should have been addressed in a
         properly conducted environmental assessment.

159.     Because problems of this nature are now associated with the Yacyretá
         resettlement schemes, a great deal of time and effort must be expended to rectify

         consequences are unnecessary expenditure of resources that could have been used
         to ensure that more affected persons were being helped than is the case.

160.     Failure to observe the Bank's safeguard policy on environmental assessment is
         having the consequences of the affected persons being dissatisfied with the
         Bank's resettlement schemes, the resettlement schemes giving rise to problems of
         storm-water run-off, overloading of sewerage lines, and the limited resources of
         the local municipal authorities being taxed. This is a situation, which neither
         Bank staff, project proponents, or affected persons desire or with which they are
         satisfied. Instead of a Bank-supported project reflecting positively on the Bank
         and its borrowers, the opposite has occurred. This Project demonstrates that
         taking short-cuts with the Bank's safeguard policies is counterproductive for
         all concerned.


                               5. FLOODINGOF URBAN CREEKS


161.     The Requesters complain that since the raising of the water level in the Yacyretá
         reservoir in 1994, the creeks, such as Poti'y, M'boi Caé, Santa Maria and Yacú
         Pasu, which cross the city of Encarnación, flood whenever it rains. This creates
         unbearable conditions for those who live on the banks of the creeks.

162.     The Requesters contend that this flooding is caused by the Yacyretá reservoir
         affecting creek flow and that the situation is further exacerbated by wastewater
         spills from the housing developments built by EBY in Buena Vista and San
         Pedro.

163.     Management denies any "causal relationship between urban creek flooding and
         raising the level of the reservoir to 76 masl."232 It also asserts that the Requester's
         claims are based on "insufficient understanding of the hydrology of the reservoir
         and neighboring urban creeks."233 Management acknowledges the "continuing
         social and human costs experienced by the population living along urban creeks"
         but states that this situation is exacerbated by other causes than the Yacyretá
         reservoir, such as the clogging of the creeks with garbage and the frequent
         phenomenon of El Niño, which brings about heavy rainfalls.234

164.     Management also argues that, from a hydrological standpoint, the flooding is not
         influenced by the current water level of the reservoir, and that the "[c]reeks are
         flowing at the same rate they would without a reservoir at 76 masl."235 In
         response to this complaint, Bank Management has presented a long flow series in

165.     To address properly the complex issues that the Requesters and Management
         Response raise, the Panel's hydrological expert has conducted two analyses. The
         first determined whether the construction of the Yacyretá dam has changed the
         flood levels of the Paraná river. The second examined whether the filling of the
         reservoir has increased the flood levels of the urban creeks. Annex B of this report
         presents the full analysis.

5.1. Relationship of Yacyretá Dam to Flood Levels of Paraná River at Encarnación

166.     The Panel finds that the construction of the Yacyretá dam has a negligible
         effect on the water level of the Paraná river at Encarnación, especially in
         times of flood.

167.     The Panel also finds that the Yacyretá reservoir is frequently operated under
         conditions that produce a water level in excess of 76 masl up to one meter at
         Encarnación, which is not consistent with the provisions of both the loan
         agreement and the Third Owners' Agreement, as amended.

168.     The Panel found that Management has accepted an error in the calculation
         of the water level at Encarnación shown in Management's Response. When
         the water level is properly calculated, the Panel found that the reservoir is

238The return period is a measure of how likely it is that a flood of a particular size will occur. It is
expressed mathematically as 1/P(x)   whereP(x) is the probability of a particular flow being exceeded. The
return period (sometimes termed "recurrence interval") should be thought of as a statistical probability
rather than a finite number of years. If the return period is 2 years, a flood of this size will occur often. If
the return period is 100 years, it will occur very seldom.

            being operated so as to exceed a water level of 76 masl by up to one meter at
            Encarnación. The following paragraphs provide the detailed analysis.

  169.      After closure of the Paraná River, about 80 km downstream of Encarnación and
            Posadas, the dam changed the natural river-level profile at the cities due to a
            "backwater effect". (This is the effect, which a dam or other obstruction has in
            raising the surface of the water upstream from the obstruction ­ illustrated in
            figure II-1 below).

  170.      The extent of the backwater effect varies as a consequence of both the water level
            at the dam (controlled by the discharge of water through turbines and sluice gates)
            and the volume of water flowing in the river. This complex relationship can be
            shown in a three variable graph. Figure II-1 shows the level of the Paraná River at
            Encarnación, allowing for backwater effect.

  171.      The Management Response attempts to demonstrate the effect that dam operation
            has on water level at Encarnación.239 In Management's analysis the dam
            operational level in masl is defined relative to the water level at Encarnación and
            Posadas, not water level at the dam site,240 thus the dash curve in Management
            Response figure 6.1, should be at 76 masl at Encarnación and not 75.7 masl, as
            shown.241 The dash curve in the Management response is 0.3 masl lower than it
            should be, thus underestimating the actual river level at Encarnación.

172.    According to Management, "for flows less than or equal to 13,000 m3/s the water
        level at Encarnación­Posadas will remain at or below 76 masl." As the flows
        increase closer to 13,000 m3/s, water levels in Encarnación­Posadas will
        essentially be those corresponding to natural river conditions without the presence
        of the Yacyretá Dam. This is incorrect.

173.    When the Panel pointed out this error during its May 2003 visit, EBY provided
        updated and corrected information showing the operating level at the dam, the
        level of the river at Encarnación, and the flow of the Paraná River.                    This
        information is from the Harza report242 (Figure II-2 below). The ordinate [y-axis]
        shows river level at Encarnación with due allowance for backwater effect, the
        abscissa [x-axis] shows river flow or volume in cubic meters per second, and each
        curve represents the water level at Encarnación under different operating levels at
        the dam and for varying river flows.

174.    As can be seen from this figure, with a river flow of 13,000 m3/s the level at
        the dam has to be near 75 masl for a water level of 76 masl to occur at
        Encarnación. (The original mistake in the Management Response was that the
        curve shown by Management represented the operation rule adopted by EBY and
        not the actual water level in the reservoir at Encarnación.)

     River and the operating level at the Dam (Harza y Consorciados, 2002).


175. The first curve of Figure II-2 (black) represents the relationship without the dam
     (natural conditions). The other curves are for the reservoir being operated at 74,
     75, 76 masl and so on. Figure II-2 also shows the operational curves. These
     operational curves are shown as horizontal lines. The first operation curve shows
     that the level at Encarnación is kept near to 76 masl until the discharge reaches
     about 13,000 m3/s, after that it follows the 75 masl curve at the dam. These
     curves show that the reservoir produces an increase in water level (backwater
     effect) at Encarnación of about 1m above the river level that would have occurred
     in the absence of the dam when the river flow is 15000 m3/s. But the dam only
     serves to increase the water depth at Encarnación by 0,2m (20 centimeters or eight
     inches) when the river flow is 30,000 m3/s. At higher flow rates the dam has
     virtually no effect at all on river height at Encarnación.             The Panel
     consequently finds that the construction of the Yacyretá dam has a negligible
     effect on the water level of the Paraná river at Encarnación, especially in
     times of flood.

176. Two periods of recorded data were sampled to verify the level of damoperation.
     The first period corresponded to a small flood in the Paraná together with very
     intense rainfall in Encarnación. In the second sample the Paraná was close to
     median flow, and there was very intense rainfall in Encarnación. The
     characteristics of these two floods were:

     (1) December/January of 97/98:       (12/21/97 to 01/10/98) During this period the
         Paraná River was flowing between 22,000 to 25,000 m3/s. On 12/29/97
         Encarnación experienced its greatest rainfall in one day (268 mm) for 50 years
         (1954-1998). Table II-2 shows the levels at the dam and at Encarnación for
         this 1997 flood.     The highest level at the Dam was 75.98 masl and at
         Encarnación the level for the same day was 77.58 masl. It can be seen from
         Table II-2 that, under natural conditions, this level would have been about
         76.8 masl. This data shows that during this period the operation rule
         being used was such as to maintain a water level of 77 masl at
         Encarnación and Posadas.

            visiting Encarnación and observed flooding of Encarnación's urban creeks at
            first hand. The Paraná River flow was 15,000m3/s (close to long term mean
            flow) and in Encarnación­Posadas there was heavy rainfall (>100 mm in 24
            hours). This is the second situation to be analyzed, it produced flooding in the
            M'boy creek and its tributaries. [Photos of this flood are presented in the
            annex A.] Using figure II-2 and these data, it may be inferred that the
            dam was being operated so as to maintain a level of 76.5m at
            Encarnación. This is confirmed in table II-3 below.

177.     As can be seen from tables II-2 and II-3, with the dam operating between 75 and
         76 masl (water level as measured at the powerhouse) the flood level in
         Encarnación remained below 78 m.              These levels were double checked with
         information from the Paraguay Navy for the same period245. During May 2003
         the Panel requested that it be provided with two years of water-level data for
         Posadas­Encarnación. This request was made to both EBY and Bank staff. The
         data was requested to verify the operational procedures actually being used in the
         Yacyretá reservoir. This information was finally received in September 2003.

178.     Using the data from the period of 6/1/2001 to 7/31/2003, received from EBY, the
         following residuals (variances) were calculated:
         Y = Ypos - Yop
         where:
         Y is the height in meters above or below the agreed operational curve during a
         day;
         Ypos is the recorded level at Posadas/Encarnación ;
         Yop is the agreed operational level (the operational level can differ from 76,0 m
         because of variable river discharge) obtained from the chart presented by EBY.

179.     Figure II-3 shows the difference between the observed level of the river at
         Encarnación and the agreed operational level of the river. A 30 day moving
         average is also shown.

                The figure shows:
                · From April to October of 2001 the actual water level fluctuated around
                      0,30 m above the agreed operational level;
                · From October 2001 to February 2002 it increased to near 0,40-0,50 m;
                · Between May and September 2002, as in 2003, there is a decrease in the
                      operational levels and for short periods the actual river level is below the
                      operational level (possibly because of floods or a decrease in energy
                      production);
                · From September 2002 to May 2003 there is a steady increase in the
                      residual, reaching 1.0 m above the 76.0 m operational curve.

         Figure II-3 Variance between observed river level and operational curve
          From the two samples analyzed as well as from an analysis of the long-term
          records, the Panel draws the conclusion that the reservoir is being operated so as
          to exceed a water level of 76 masl at Encarnación, but not at a level that would
          cause flooding of urban areas (78 masl).

180.      From the above analysis the Panel finds that the contention of affected
          persons that the Yacyretá reservoir is frequently operated under conditions
          that produce a water level in excess of 76 masl at Encarnación is correct.246
          The excess, however, is limited to one meter or less.

181.      The correction in the method of calculation has been accepted by EBY
          engineering staff. While this error has not yet had any serious direct consequences

         for the Project, continued use by EBY and the Bank of an incorrect value for the
         water height at Encarnación would further erode local confidence in the reliability
         of official pronouncements concerning the dam and its operations.

5.2. Flooding of the Potí'y, Mboy Caé, Santa Maria and Yacú Paso Creeks
182.     The Requesters have claimed that the water level at which the reservoir of the
         Yacyretá Dam is being operated is causing the urban creeks in Encarnación to
         flood.

183.     Rainfall records for Encarnación show that precipitation in excess of 100 mm in a
         day occurs, on average, several times per year. This is evident in the record long
         before the construction of the Yacyretá dam. Rainfall of this intensity will give
         rise to rapid surface runoff, especially in areas over clay surface deposits, such as
         the weathered basalt on which much of Encarnación is situated. With the steep
         terrain of Encarnación this runoff will rapidly reach the creeks and cause them to
         overflow onto their flood plains. This is a normal occurrence, which should be
         anticipated and expected.

184.     The Requesters attribute both an increase in flood frequency and depth to the
         inundation of the Yacyretá reservoir in 1994. No rationale is provided for this
         assertion other than that the water table in the vicinity of the reservoir will have
         been raised by its presence.        This is likely to be true in wetlands and
         unconsolidated sediments in close proximity to the reservoir. It is not likely to be
         true for the basaltic rocks on which most of Encarnación is situated.

185.     Bank Management dispute a causal relationship between flooding of the urban
         creeks and the Yacyretá reservoir.247 Instead they attribute urban flooding to
         garbage clogging the urban creeks thus reducing their efficacy in discharging
         intense rainfall.248 They attribute the increased frequency of floods to increased
         El Niño events, and the increased social cost, to the poorly controlled influx of
         persons to the urban floodplains.249

186.     Direct observation of the urban creek flooding which occurred on 22 January
         2003 and inundated houses on the flood plain of the Arroyo Potí'y and the M'boi
         Caé indicated rapidly flowing water in the creeks and their floodplains.         Te
         marked red colored sediment load in the creek waters contrasts with the gray-
         green color of the water in the Yacyretá reservoir. This strongly suggests that the
         urban creek flooding is not being caused by floodwater in the creeks being
         backed-up from the Yacyretá reservoir. A technical analysis of the extent to
         which the Yacyretá reservoir effects flow in the urban creeks at Encarnación is
         given in Annex A.

                                                                                           61

187.     From the analysis in Annex A it can be concluded that at a water level of 76 masl
         the reservoir has no effect on the floods in the M'boi Caé. With the reservoir at 78
         masl the effect will be minimal (1cm) and confined to the section in the
         neighborhood of the juncture of the M'boi Caé with the Paraná River.

188.     For the Potí'y Creek at Villa Candida the increased flooding is not due to the
         Yacyretá reservoir, as at a reservoir range of 76 to 78 masl the reservoir has no
         backwater influence on the water levels in the Potí'y Creek.

189.     The hydrological assessments show clearly that flood impacts in the urban creeks
         in the city of Encarnación are not caused by the reservoir or its operations.
         Neither Paraná River floods nor backwater in the M'boi Caé is sufficient to cause
         the levels of flooding experienced in the urban creeks. Thus although it is clear
         that the urban creeks of Encarnación are flooding and causing severe
         hardship, the Panel finds that the Requesters contention that this flooding is
         a consequence of the Yacyretá reservoir cannot be sustained.                                    The
         hydrological assessments show that neither the Paraná River floods nor
         backwater in the M'boi Caé is sufficient to cause the levels of flooding
         experienced in the urban creeks.

190.     The urban creek flood conditions are mainly due to local conditions, such as
         upstream urbanization, lack of urban storm water drainage, and waste
         accumulation impeding water flow in the creeks, in that order of importance.
         The contribution of specific resettlement areas to flood peak downstream is
         estimated as low. But the sum of all urbanization done upstream during the
         last years has increased the frequency and the peak level of the floods. 250
         Failure to anticipate the flooding due to increased urbanization is another aspect
         of the deficiencies in the EA discussed in section 4.5 of this Report.




                     Figure 5 Villa Candida, Encarnación, on sunny and rainy days.



250 It has been established in other cities and other studies that urbanization increases impervious surfaces
such as streets, roofs, walk ways etc. This in turn may increase the mean annual peak flood by as much as
six times over that which occurs in former rural conditions. See Luna Bergere Leopold, Hydrology for
Urban Land Planning: A Guide Book on the Hydrologic Effects of Urban Land Use, U.S. Geological
Survey Circular 554, (Washington: U.S. Geological Survey, 1968).

                       6. WATER QUALITY AND HEALTH STANDARDS


191.    The Requesters claim that the reservoir has caused contamination of ground water
        and severe health problems. This potentially violates a number of requirements in
        OD 4.01 regarding environmental assessment.


6.1. Environmental Pollution and Water Quality

192.    Environmental studies undertaken in 1992251 indicated that the water quality of
        the urban creeks, especially in Encarnación, was poor. The Panel observed that
        the problem still exists. The Panel observed discharge of untreated domestic
        sewage into the creeks, as well as water contamination by domestic and
        commercial wastes.

193.    The Requesters believe that the construction of the dam caused environmental
        pollution and "forced numerous families to live in a totally contaminated and
        unhealthful environment."252

194.    They contend that the Yacyretá reservoir has caused pollution of their drinking
        water wells and flooded their pit latrines. For this to be factually correct the
        ground water table in Encarnación must have been raised by the Yacyretá
        reservoir, and this will only occur if the reservoir has raised the level of the
        Paraná river and the creeks flowing into it. It was shown above that this has not
        occurred. The Panel finds that the alleged causal relationship between the
        level of the Yacyretá reservoir and pollution of wells and flooding of latrines
        is thus not correct.253          The Panel confirms, however, the Requesters'
        statements that flooding of the urban creeks renders drinking water wells on
        the flood plain unsuitable for use. This is a matter of simple observation and
        is uncontestable. The Panel observed first-hand that the open roadside drains
        passing through the poor neighborhoods of Encarnación were carrying sewage
        and domestic waste directly to the creeks, which had recently overflowed into,
        wells and latrines.

195.    With respect to the Requesters' claim that the Yacyretá reservoir has caused
        environmental pollution Management responds that the dam has neither caused
        nor increased environmental pollution in the area of Encarnación-Posadas.254
        Management states that the water quality monitoring programs demonstrate that
        there are no significant water quality issues in the reservoir, and that monitoring
        shows that, after filling the reservoir to 76 masl there have been no significant
        changes in key physical and chemical parameters in the main water body of the

                                                                                         63

         reservoir at Encarnación or Posadas.255 Management further claims that the
         reservoir's water quality is oligotrophic, very low in nutrient and organic
         materials, mainly because of the reservoir's low hydraulic retention time (less
         than five days).256

196.     The meaning of the term "environmental pollution" may be subject to
         interpretation. In the context in which it is used it is taken to apply to water
         quality. The Panel observed that reservoir water quality monitoring has been
         an ongoing activity contracted out by EBY and checked by Bank staff since
         before the filling of the Yacyretá reservoir. The Panel verified the existence
         of the monitoring data and reasonableness of Management's claim that "the
         reservoir's water quality is constantly monitored, falls within satisfactory
         parameters..."257     This was done by studying the relevant reports on file in
         Washington D.C. as well as in the EBY database in Encarnación.258 The Panel
         finds that Bank Management has ensured that proper monitoring of water
         quality has been conducted in the reservoir.


6.2. Health Problems

197.     The Request alleges that the "reservoir has caused severe health problems,"
         because "the lake filled with stagnant, polluted water with sewage waste, is an
         ideal habitat for microorganisms [sic] that are vectors of serious disease such as
         malaria..." The Requesters state that "since the reservoir was filled, people living
         in the area of influence have complained of a high incidence of fever."

198.     In the Requesters' view, the alleged adverse health impacts the reservoir caused
         on the population living in the project area were not adequately monitored. They
         claim that "there were no programs for monitoring and controlling disease
         causing microorganism, and if this remains unresolved it could lead to an
         alarming and catastrophic health situation."

199.     Management asserts that, since 1997, the reservoir has not caused health problems
         and that there is no evidence that the situation has changed. Management
         attributes water-related diseases and diarrhea to the pre-existing condition of lack
         of potable water supply and sanitation services. In addition, none of the diseases
         mentioned in the claim have increased on a per capita basis within the project area
         since the reservoir filling. Management also notes that the urban families resettled
         by the Yacyretá Project have access to potable water and adequate sanitation,
         which substantially reduces water-borne diseases.259

200.     Management also recognizes that disease vectors are endemic to the Paraná River
         basin, adding that these vector species were present in the Yacyretá Project area
         long before dam construction began. Furthermore, Management claims that the
         Yacyretá Project has provided assistance to the Ministry of Public Health and
         Social Welfare in Paraguay to improve its capacity for disease vector monitoring,
         while the EMP proposes sanitation programs for the urban centers, as well as
         intensive monitoring programs of vector and health conditions in the area.
         According to Management the systematic vector monitoring is carried out by the
         Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare on a regular basis.260

201.     Management claims that, since 1992, EBY has provided funds to SENEPA in the
         Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare of Paraguay to carry out systematic
         and continuous monitoring of insect vectors of diseases and the outbreaks of
         certain diseases. Management also states that the EMP supports the recurrent
         costs of monitoring public health (vectors and diseases), water quality, aquatic
         vegetation, and fish populations and migrations, along with the conservation of
         protected areas, fisheries, and endangered species.261

202.     The Panel confirmed that the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of
         Paraguay adequately monitors the incidence of both disease and disease
         vectors. The Ministry of Health Documents reporting on health related matters
         are available to interested parties from the public information office of EBY.
         Under the EMP, EBY is required to meet the costs of public health monitoring in
         the area affected by the Yacyretá Project.262

203.     Management refers to the disease monitoring program being undertaken by the
         Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Paraguay. The bimonthly reports
         provided by this Ministry263 indicate no per capita increase in the diseases that
         have been monitored since filling of the reservoir. The Panel verified the
         existence of the monitoring program, reviewed its findings, and found no
         evidence contradicting the findings.264

204.     A frequent complaint to the Panel during site visits was that women suffer
         constantly from itchy skin, particularly on their hands and arms. This is attributed
         to the use of polluted water for washing clothes. The Panel notes that the Yacyretá
         reservoir is not the cause of the polluted water used by the complainants for
         washing clothes. There are potentially many different reasons why such skin
         irritations might occur.

205.     The Panel notes that it is not disputed that disease vectors are present in the
         Paraná river system. Disagreement focuses on whether there has been an increase

         in their abundance since the Yacyretá reservoir was created. Management refers
         to the vector monitoring program being undertaken by the Ministry of Health and
         Social Welfare of Paraguay. This long-term ongoing study shows no increase in
         abundance or species composition of disease vectors. The Panel verified the
         existence and findings of this study and found no evidence to the contrary.


                              7. WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT


206.     The conditions for sewage discharge in Encarnación have been poor for many
         years, with numerous discharges of wastewater directly into creeks and other
         water bodies. Accordingly, and to avoid contamination of the lateral embayment
         that will be formed with the reservoir at 83 masl, the Bank has required that a
         sewage treatment system be provided for Encarnación so as to avoid more such
         pollution. In doing this, the first step required under Bank policy is that a proper
         environmental assessment be done for the construction of a new wastewater
         treatment plant.265

7.1. Environmental Assessment for Plant Location

207.     The Request emphasizes that the claimants are opposed to the location selected
         for the planned wastewater treatment plant. The Requesters claim that the site
         "will not allow for future expansion", thus precluding "appropriate sanitation
         networks" for future generations. The Request also complains that the decisions
         related to the treatment plant were taken in violation of environmental laws of
         Paraguay and were based on a defective environmental assessment, as no
         consultations with affected people and NGOs have taken place during the
         preparation of the plant's environmental assessment.

208.     Management acknowledges that a number of residents of Encarnación are
         opposed to the site selected for the wastewater treatment plant. However,
         Management supported its construction because the plant will bring long-term
         health benefits to the local community as it will be connected to the projected
         sewer network.266

209.     Management states that the Bank reviewed the Environmental Impact Assessment
         for the plant and that the EA included analysis of alternative sites and treatment
         options. It also claims that       "meaningful public consultation was carried out
         regarding the site and design for the wastewater treatment plant early on in the
         process."267     According to the Response, the Secretary of Environment of
         Paraguay (SEAM), which issued the relevant environmental license, also
         reviewed and approved the environmental impact study. In addition, international


265The term "sewerage" can also be used to refer to the removal of wastewater and refuse by means of
sewers, or a system of sewers.

                                                                                                    66

         consultants that the Bank contracted "concurred that the proposed site is
         adequate and that the plant [would] not pose any risks to the surrounding
         communities and environment."268

210.     The Panel reviewed the environmental assessment documentation; it studied the
         independent consultant's report,269 visited the site270 and examined a map
         showing the alternative sites. The Panel also questioned both Bank271 and EBY272
         staff that had been involved in decisions pertaining to the siting of the sewage
         treatment plant. Affected parties also raised the matter during consultations with
         the Panel while it was in Encarnación.

211.     The Panel understands the concerns of the residents of La Esperanza, the peri-
         urban neighborhood that is closest to the site for the sewage treatment plant. The
         Panel notes that the design and layout of the plant makes provision for it to be
         screened and separated from the cultural monument erected to record the site on
         which the Pope celebrated Mass. Provision has been made for the site to be
         elevated above extreme flood levels in the Paraná River and for the outfall to the
         river to be well away from the shoreline. No reasonable threats from the plant to
         the health or safety of the residents of La Esperanza or any other neighborhood, or
         to the children's hospital or to the technical university could be substantiated. The
         Panel finds that the site selected for the sewage treatment plant is not
         inappropriate for the purpose and that the associated environmental
         assessment is not defective either procedurally or substantively. The Panel
         notes, however, that although the selection of the plant's location complied with
         Bank policies and procedures, nearby residents may continue to be concerned lest
         a bad odor emanate from the treatment plant and pumping stations, which would
         affect the quality of life of the people living in the neighborhood and the value of
         their properties.

7.2. Plant Design

212.     The environmental pollution the Requesters complain about worsened, in their
         view, when EBY built the housing developments of Buena Vista and San Pedro,
         because the houses' wastewaters allegedly spill into the urban creeks and
         contaminate them. The Request claims also that this situation will not be solved
         because, FEDAYIM holds, "the planned Wastewater Treatment Plant will not
         benefit these neighborhoods build by EBY nor others affected by the rise of the
         water table."

213.     Management acknowledges the poor conditions of sewage discharges' in
         Encarnación and the numerous discharges of wastewater to creeks and other water
         bodies. However, Management adds that to overcome the sanitation problems,
         "CORPOSANA273and the Municipality of Encarnación designed and will
         undertake construction of the sewerage system and wastewater treatment plant.
         The sewerage systems are intended to cover 100 percent of all urban areas in
         Encarnación, including housing developments not built by EBY. The system
         designed includes waste discharges from Buena Vista and San Pedro areas,
         which are being discharged into creeks until the sewerage system is completed."
         (emphasis added).274 Management adds that the IDB loan no. 760, which is also
         financing the Project, "will finance the wastewater treatment plant, interceptors,
         pumping station and sewerage network. The construction of the sewerage system
         will facilitate a full recovery of urban creeks (particularly when coupled with
         appropriate waste disposal) and is a condition for increasing water levels in the
         reservoir."275

214.     The Panel notes that the conditions listed in the Project Agreement (Loan 3520-
         AR) as "[a]ctivities to be Completed to Raise the Reservoir Level Above El 76m
         to EL 78m (Party responsible for this [sic] activities: EBY)"276 include the
         following: "(a) sewage collection and treatment systems completed in Posadas
         and Encarnación, including construction of: (i) primary sewage collectors and
         interceptors; and (ii) sewage treatment plants of other adequate facility."277

215.     Confusion may have arisen over the coverage of the wastewater treatment
         plant because the detailed drawings of the planned sewerage reticulation
         system for Encarnación were not available in the EBY public information
         office. On request the Panel was provided with the detailed drawings for the
         sewerage system. The Panel found that it is planned that the resettlement
         areas in question will be linked to the reticulated sewerage system.

216.     The Panel finds that the design and environmental assessment of the sewage
         and wastewater treatment plant is in compliance with OD 4.01. The Panel
         notes with great concern, however, that although according to Management
         the sewerage system has been designed to cover the city of Encarnación, the
         works described in the current bidding documents for the construction of the
         system seem to cover only the southern part of Encarnación (zona sur).278

217.     Although the sewer system to serve Encarnación is under construction and
         construction of the wastewater treatment plant is due to commence in early 2004,
         the Panel could not elicit a definite answer as to who will be responsible for
         connecting domestic users to the new sewer network. EBY staff informed the
         Panel that the residents of Encarnación will themselves be responsible for
         connecting their houses to the system.279 This provision is likely to negate the
         purpose of the sewerage reticulation scheme as few of the residents of the poorer
         neighborhoods will have the capital, or disposable income, to pay for their
         connection to the network. They are thus likely to continue to discharge sewage
         to open drains or to septic tanks. Bank staff are also of this opinion. One Bank
         staff member noted that if the connection of houses to sewers must be paid for by
         the owners, it will never happen.280

218.     Based on interviews with affected people, EBY, and Bank staff, the Panel finds
         that responsibility for the cost of connection to the sewer system may become
         a significant source of conflict in the not too distant future. If the matter is not
         resolved in a way that will enable the vast majority of households to be connected
         to the sewer lines, the entire exercise of providing a sewer network will be largely
         negated. The Panel finds that this issue needs the urgent attention of Bank
         Management and that an effective means of financing the connection of
         houses to the sewer, plant and network is required, especially for poor
         communities.

7.4. Transfer and Supervision of Sewerage Reticulation and Treatment System

219.     As noted above the sewer system for Encarnación is under construction, and work
         on the sewerage treatment plant will start during the first months of 2004. The
         Panel was told by EBY281 that they will finance and supervise construction of the
         new sewage collection and treatment plant but that the operation and maintenance
         of the system is to be transferred to either CORPOSANA or the Encarnación local
         authorities.

220.     Officials of one Encarnación local authority expressed the concern282 that
         although CORPOSANA had the necessary technical expertise to run the sewage
         treatment system, this body was based in Asunción, Paraguay, hundreds of
         kilometers away and that it is impractical for the day-today operation of the
         Encarnación sewage plant to be run from another city. They also told the Panel
         that although it would be desirable for them to assume responsibility for the
         sewage treatment system as they were locally based they did not have the
         necessary expertise, budget or staff to do so. In their view these matters need to be
         addressed in order for them to assume this responsibility effectively.

221. The Panel finds that Management must give urgent attention to the
     practicalities of transferring operation and maintenance of the sewage
     treatment system away from EBY and to ensuring that the new operators are
     provided with adequate staff, budget and training to be able to run the
     sewage system efficiently and effectively. This is especially urgent because the
     sewage system includes a bypass at each pumping station that will dump raw
     sewage into neighboring urban creeks in cases of pump malfunction or
     overflow.

                         8. IDENTIFICATIONOF AFFECTED PEOPLE

8.1. Identification of Affected People

222.     The Request claims that thousands of eligible families have been excluded from
         the compensation and mitigation programs provided under the Project's
         resettlement programs. According to the Request, many families have received no
         compensation despite owning or occupying lands in the project area for more than
         twenty years. In the Requesters view, this has resulted from a failure correctly to
         identify the people that would be affected by Yacyretá.

223.     Many families the Panel met during its visits to the Yacyretá Project area claimed
         that they were simply missed in the 1990 census (the means for identifying
         affected people) though, they said, they were present at the time of the census.
         They asserted that, as a result, they had not received compensation. They are
         worried that they will never receive compensation as involuntarily displaced
         persons.

224.     Management states that the Requester's claim that not all the affected people have
         been properly identified "is not supported by available evidence."283 In fact,
         according to the Response, "[f]amilies affected by the raising of the level and/or
         operation at 76 masl have been properly identified and compensated, even though
         some families remain dissatisfied with the solutions provided."284

225.     Management Response states that in 1980 EBY conducted the first census of the
         people to be resettled and/or compensated, and in 1990 it organized a second
         census that took into consideration demographic changes that had occurred in the
         preceding ten years.285 According to Management, "[a]ll families included in the
         updated census of 1990 who were living in areas below 78 masl have been
         compensated and/or relocated"286 via the pre-1992 resettlement plan, the RRAPP
         adopted in 1992, and Plans A and B.287           In addition, the Third Owners'
         Agreement288 established that the government of Paraguay would be responsible,
         using its own funds, for the resettlement of the families not included in the 1990
         census.289 Finally, Management reports that, because of the time since the latest
         census, the data about the affected people are being updated, especially in relation
         to the people living between 78 and 83 masl. EBY estimates that the completion
         of the project would require resettling 5,454 people in Argentina and 6,380 in
         Paraguay, where 360 commercial properties containing 700 businesses would also
         need to be relocated (see Map 3).290

         surveys should be addressed is OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement.           The
         objective of this OD is primarily to "ensure that the population displaced by a
         project receives benefits from it."291 The policy objectives for achieving this are
         to avoid resettlement where feasible292 and, in cases where resettlement is
         unavoidable, to develop adequate resettlement plans that are conceived and
         executed as development programs.293 In order to do so, OD 4.30 requires that
         resettlement plans be "based on recent information about the scale and impact of
         resettlement on the displaced population" and emphasizes that "[s]ocioeconomic
         surveys, recording the names of affected families, should be conducted as early as
         possible to prevent inflows of population ineligible for compensation."294
         Accordingly, socioeconomic surveys should include, inter alia, standard
         household characteristics, the magnitude of the displacement, and information on
         the full resource base of the affected population.

8.1.1. Census Procedures

227.     In order to consider the Requesters' claims, it is essential to evaluate the
         procedures used in conducting the censuses over the last twenty-five years.

8.1.1.1. First Census of the Affected Population: 1979-1980

228.     "In 1980 EBY conducted the first census of all families that needed to be resettled
         and/or compensated as a result of raising the level of the reservoir up to 83
         masl."295 Following preliminary studies from 1973 to 1979, EBY undertook the
         first household census of affected areas population in Argentina in 1979 and in
         Paraguay in 1980. This was the first of a series of censuses and surveys of the
         affected population.       The 1979 to 1980 household census identified 7,700
         beneficiaries, of whom 6,000 were urban (4,100 in Argentina and 1,900 in
         Paraguay) and 1,700 were rural (300 in Argentina and 1,400 in Paraguay).296

229.     At the time of the 1980 census, EBY acknowledged the population identified in
         the 1979 Argentine census and the 1980 Paraguayan census as "beneficiaries" of
         the Project. During interviews with Bank staff, one expert emphasized that the
         expectation conveyed to the people that those who were included in the 1980
         census would benefit from the project was a major "technical error" on the part of
         EBY, adding that it would have been much better for EBY to have said that the
         census was intended merely to gather data because of the possibility that the
         region might be affected by the hydroelectric project.297

                                                                                         74

230.     Bank and EBY officials agree that by identifying all persons residing in the area
         as "beneficiaries" eligible to receive favorable compensation from the
         hydroelectric project, they encouraged the population residing in the affected area
         to increase dramatically as the hydroelectric works were constructed. Without the
         Yacyretá Project, many people would have probably moved to the project area as
         part of a normal movement of population and then on to an urban environment or
         better land at a higher elevation. However, when people became identified as
         beneficiaries, there was much less incentive for people who would "normally"
         have moved out to do so.        Similarly, the new incentives introduced by the
         resettlement plans encouraged changes in the developmental cycles of local
         households. Children who had moved away returned to take up residence so as to
         become eligible for compensation and a new house (even though they may have
         been away at the time of the census). When marriages occurred with persons
         from outside this area, the spouse who was ineligible for compensation moved
         into the area to stay with or near the spouse's parents to await compensation,
         rather than move the family to the other spouse's home or region.

231.     As years passed and resettlement was postponed, children growing up in these
         households were less likely to follow what would have been a normal pattern of
         movement to work, marry, and live in other places, because they feared losing
         their eligibility for compensation.

8.1.1.2. The 1990 Census and Later Verifications

232.     The growth and changes in the population of the area after 1980 led to a new
         census in 1989 to 1990. This census "established the baseline of those requiring
         eventual resettlement as a result of the Yacyretá Project."298 Management states
         that "in compliance with OD 4.30 EBY's resettlement and/or compensation
         obligations established in the RRAP and in Plans A and B are limited to the 1990
         census families."299 However, despite the Bank's efforts to encourage the
         government of Paraguay to restrict immigration into the area, there has been a
         substantial increase since 1990 in the population of the areas to be flooded. This
         is due to normal social mobility and family changes, as well as to the movement
         of poor people into the floodplain specifically to become eligible for
         compensation. Since 1990, EBY has continued surveying and mapping efforts to
         document the size of households and to map the property improvements,
         including most recently a "verification" survey of 2000, to determine anew the
         numbers of people to be compensated and the values of property needing to be
         expropriated.

8.1.2. Adequacy of Census Procedures

233.   During the Panel's visits, people provided 1980 census documents indicating their
       presence in the project area at that time and in some cases also documents
       showing their presence after 1990. These people claim to have been present at the
       time of the 1990 census but to have been missed by census-takers. They state that
       they have been unable to be included retroactively in the 1990 census. While it
       was impossible for the Panel to determine exactly why all of the people were not
       included in the 1980 or 1990 census, the Panel reviewed documents showing, for
       example, that individual children were left out of a household's census even
       though the child's baptismal certificate showed that he/she was part of the
       household at the time of the 1990 census.

234.   The Panel brought the examples of persons excluded from the census to the
       attention of EBY during its January 2003 visit to the project area. EBY
       acknowledged that, as with censuses in any country, no census is perfect, but
       stated that there is a procedure for someone missed in the census to be effectively
       put back in, for example by bringing evidence that the person was in a hospital or
       jail, etc. In December 2003, EBY staff further clarified that EBY recognized that
       it had erroneously omitted approximately ten to twelve households from the 1990
       census. While they could not be retroactively included in the 1990 census, EBY
       assured the Panel that those households will be treated as if they had been
       included.

235.   These statements, however, contrasted sharply with the statements by many
       affected villagers who complained that they had repeatedly tried to be included on
       the census lists but were turned away. In one case, a cattle farmer was reportedly
       told that the consultants hired to do the census had left so it was too late to be
       included. In other cases, villagers told the Panel that they had repeatedly visited
       EBY offices trying to get included but had been told that the census was already
       completed.

236.   The Panel finds persuasive evidence that a number of people who were
       present at the time of the 1990 census were erroneously omitted and that they
       fear they will be ineligible for the Project's compensation and resettlement
       benefits. This finding is based upon statements both by those who claim they
       were excluded and their neighbors and (in some cases) on documentary and other
       evidence of their presence in the affected area before and after 1990. The Panel
       interviewed a significant number of people residing in the area who showed
       documentary evidence of inclusion in the 1980 census but who were not included
       in the 1990 census in spite of their continuous presence in the area, which was
       independently verified by the Panel.

237.   In accordance with the Third Owners' Agreement, however, all people who were
       not recorded in the 1990 census but appear in the later eligibility surveys will




                                                                                       76

        receive compensation.300 The difference is that the costs of compensation or
        resettlement for these "extra-censales" (persons who were not in the 1990 census
        but appear in later surveys) will be borne by the governments of Paraguay (on the
        Paraguayan side of the river) and by Argentina (on the other side), rather than by
        EBY. People missed by the 1990 census will thus not be denied compensation.
        This point was also made by EBY officials when the Panel provided them with
        examples of people whose documents indicated they were almost certainly
        present in 1990 and that the 1990 census passed them by. The point can be taken
        to justify why EBY does not expend great resources trying to retroactively tinker
        with the 1990 census--the compensation will be the same, except that EBY funds
        would not be used for the "extra-censales."

238.    There are several reasons, however, why affected persons are concerned by their
        non-inclusion in the 1990 census. One is the local perception, as stated to the
        Panel, that if payment is the responsibility of the government of Paraguay (rather
        than EBY under Bank auspices), they may not receive compensation because of
        the country's limited budgetary resources. Another is the concern that they would
        have less recourse to appeal. The Panel requested information from EBY offices
        in Encarnación about the means by which the government of Paraguay would pay
        for relocation of all the extra-censales, and was provided a copy of a ministerial
        letter that confirmed an agreement by which EBY would pay for the relocation
        costs of the extra-censales population at the time they are moved.301 These costs
        would then be reimbursed to EBY by the government of Paraguay via deductions
        from the portion of the electricity sale royalties that would eventually accrue to
        the government of Paraguay.302

239.    Since there are very different perceptions as to whether people have been
        erroneously omitted from the 1990 census, and since this affects the source of
        funds available for compensation, the Panel finds that the Bank needs to insist that
        EBY clearly publicize the criteria and the procedures for correcting census
        information and develop a standard set of forms of evidence. Because EBY's own
        officials insist that there is a procedure that has been followed, the Panel finds
        that there would be much to gain from clarifying the procedure that is to be
        used and developing a standard application form that would allow claimants
        to provide documents or testimonial evidence and to request a correction to
        information contained in census documents.

240.    The Panel is also concerned about whether the topographical contours used to
        identify the affected areas at different levels of reservoir operation are in all cases
        correct. The Panel visited the area of Resquin Cué, in the vicinity of the town of
        Coronel Bogado, and interviewed the residents. They showed the Panel their red
        folders indicating that they were included in the 1980 census as affected people

          living between 78 and 83 masl level, but their lands, as shown to the Panel, were
          already partially flooded at the time of the Panel's visits in May and December
          2003. If they were identified as living below 78 masl, they would have been
          eligible for resettlement and compensation before those living above 78 masl.
          This situation raises the issue of whether the topographical contours of the
          affected area in relation to the several levels of flooding were correctly drawn.

241.      The Panel brought this issue to EBY's attention during the December 2003 visit.
          EBY officers agreed to look into the problem and also told the Panel that, should
          the claims have merit, they would include the affected people from Resquin Cué
          in existing compensation programs, such as the PDA.303 Recently, the EBY
          informed the Panel that it is carrying out a cadastral survey of the area.

242.      The Panel finds that before the water level is raised further, the Bank must
          ensure that the existing census and survey data will be updated and verified
          in a manner consistent with the requirements of OD 4.30. The survey needs
          to pay special attention to the accuracy of existing geographical and
          topographic boundaries of the affected areas to allow proper identification of
          the affected people. The Panel notes that the Requesters have proposed that a
          new, corrective "general and participatory census" be undertaken. The Panel
          also notes that the Aide Memoire signed by the members of the Bank supervision
          mission of October 2003 also recommends updating the RRAP (Resettlement and
          Rehabilitation Action Plan), including updating the census of the population to be
          displaced by the project.304

8.2. Criteria for Inclusion in Specific Classes of Affected Persons

243.      A person's eligibility for certain kinds of compensation for lost productive
          income is partly determined by the person's "primary occupation" specifically
          listed in the 1990 census. This is the case for brick-makers and fishermen. The
          Requesters claim that the definition of who constitutes a brick-maker or fisherman
          for purposes of compensation does not necessarily reflect the fact that many
          people not so listed lost significant income from their brick-making and fishing
          activities. As a result, that lost income has not been compensated due to the
          criteria used to define these classes of affected persons.

244.      For example, although for many people fishing was not their principal occupation,
          as defined in the respective compensation instrument,305 they can nevertheless


303EBY officers told the Panel that at least one case similar to the ones that allegedly occurred in Resquin
Cué has been identified in the area of Caraguatá, Paraguay. EBY officers also stated that the affected
person whose property was inundated has already been properly compensated.
304See infra §12.4.
305Entitad Binacional Yacyretá, Reun. Ord. No. 136, Resolution No. 930/99, Procedimiento para el
"Programa de Apoyo a la Actividad Desarrollada por los Pescadores del Embalse de Yacyretá en la
Margen Derecha." The Resolution states that fisherman is considered "any person for whom the fishing
activity in the area of the Yacyretá Reservoir is the principal source of income and family sustenance." In
order to have the right to be considered fishermen, in order to be a part of the program of support, one


                                                                                                          78

         prove that they have lost substantial income or income-equivalent due to a loss of
         access to fishing resources.

245.     The Panel finds that the restoration of income-earning capacity under OD
         4.30 may not be achieved when compensation for income losses is based
         solely on the "principal occupation" of the affected persons. The Panel notes
         that a person could have other occupations that contribute substantially to
         their overall personal income. The Panel is aware, however, of the practical
         problems of restoring income for more than one principal occupation.

246.     The Panel finds that the sole reliance on an individual's principal occupation
         as a basis for income restoration does not satisfy the OD 4.30's requirement
         for many affected people.

8.3. Grievance Procedures

247.     OD 4.30 acknowledges that "Disputes of varying kinds may arise in the process of
         implementation of the agreed resettlement plan. These conflicts could take the
         form of appeals related to the compensation payable to affected persons, conflicts
         between the displaced persons and the host population, appeals to the agency
         charged with the implementation of the resettlement with regard to services
         promised, etc."306 OD 4.30 provides that "it is therefore important to devise
         schemes for conflict resolution for all resettlement plans. Such schemes should, as
         far as possible, take into account existing procedures for settling disputes in the
         country or area concerned."307

248.     Affected people would normally resolve a number of their concerns through an
         appropriate conflict resolution mechanism provided as part of a resettlement plan
         consistent with the provision of OD 4.30. As discussed above, a number of
         people feel that they have been left out of the censuses that were carried out by
         EBY to identify people affected by the project and to determine the benefits or
         compensation that they should receive under the project. Although the Panel was
         informed that there were some procedures to rectify any omissions and entries in
         the 1990 census, the Panel finds that at best these procedures were ad hoc
         arrangements that allowed some corrections to the census. Most people who
         felt excluded did not have a clear and objective method to bring their
         concerns to EBY.

249.     The Panel further finds that the procedures for correcting the census and
         other resettlement related omissions and errors are inadequate and notes



must fulfill any of the following conditions: to be registered by the 1990 census as a fisherman and not have
been compensated for any other productive activity or to have the fisherman's card from the navy or the
agricultural ministry (dated) until July 1998."

         that a standard and transparent appeals procedure is not available to
         affected people. This does not comply with OD 4.30.308


8.4. Other Categories of Affected People

250.     The Yacyretá Project has also affected people already living in areas near the
         resettlement sites.     During the January 2003 field visit, the Panel met with
         affected "host populations" at resettlement sites.      These included a group of
         people who were at that time organizing themselves to seek recognition as
         "affected persons" harmed by the Project. In their view, the poor drainage at the
         new resettlement site of Arroyo Porá caused flooding of their properties.

251.     OD 4.30 requires that host communities should be informed and consulted and
         states that "conditions and services in host communities should improve, or at
         least not deteriorate."309

252.     As already noted in the chapter related to the environmental assessment, the Panel
         observed that, because of extremely poor drainage installed at Arroyo Porá, the
         nearby area (a neighborhood called "Barrio América") suffered frequent flooding
         from rain water runoff from the new construction resettlement site. Effectively,
         the inhabitants of this neighborhood, who live well above the 84 masl level but
         just below the new resettlement site, have become a new population of adversely
         affected people, at least until the drainage and flooding problems are corrected.

253.     The Panel observed a similar situation in December 2003 when it visited the
         Arroyo Porá II site at an early stage of construction. The site lies close to, though
         at a slightly higher elevation than, a neighborhood called Barrio Tacuary. The
         site had already been initially prepared by earth movements that filled a wetland
         area near the source of the creek that provides water to this Barrio. A sewage
         pumping station was being constructed that included a bypass canal, which,
         according to local residents, had been designed to dump raw sewage into the
         creek in case of system overflow. The residents of that Barrio stated that for the
         prior six months there had been considerable siltation and pollution of the local
         wells and the creek that arise from the spring. They considered this to be due to
         the large amount of exposed soil. EBY officials later admitted to the Panel that
         construction had begun on this new resettlement site neighborhood before the
         required approvals from the Ministry of the Environment had been obtained,
         though papers required for approvals had been submitted.

254.     It appears that Bank staff had not checked whether site selection and construction
         was consistent with Bank's policies and local environmental requirements. EBY
         staff expressed the opinion that the siltation was probably a temporary effect of
         the construction. In any event, construction already has had a severe negative

         impact on the affected host population for about six months, and no Bank action
         seems to have been taken.

255.     The school at San Cosme y Damian offers another example of a host population
         adversely affected by the project. According to letters provided to the Panel, the
         school has become very crowded and is operating beyond its capacity. The large
         influx of resettled families with children has reportedly caused the quality of
         schooling services and education to decline.         The Panel believes that an
         appropriate consultation process and the timely design of mitigation measures
         might have prevented such negative impact.

256.     The Panel finds evidence that host populations near resettlement sites are in
         some cases adversely affected by the design and construction of the
         resettlement sites, or by added burdens on local infrastructure due to the
         influx of resettled population.       OD 4.30 and OD 4.01 require that such
         impacts be assessed and mitigated. The Panel has already noted its finding
         that new resettlement construction should have had adequate environmental
         and social impact assessments.

257.     The Panel also finds that there was inadequate effort on the part of the Bank
         to ensure that the host population was informed and consulted with in
         planning and carrying out construction of the resettlement sites as required
         by OD 4.30.310


                           9. RESETTLEMENT AND COMPENSATION


258.     The Request claims that the Bank has failed to ensure proper compensation and
         resettlement to the affected people.

259.     According to the Management Response, "Management believes that proper
         compensation and resettlement has been provided to all families, both census as
         well as post-census families, living in areas up to 78 masl...through actions
         included in: (a) the Resettlement and Social Action Plan that was applied until
         1992; and (b) the RRAP after 1992"311 as required by OD 4.30. Management
         states that "[a]ll the affected people in the project area, whether or not they
         formally own the affected property, are entitled to a new house and a lot with
         utilities at no cost."312 As a result, up to July 2002 (the date of the Management
         Response), "EBY has resettled 5,378 families in new houses or farms... including

                                                                                        81

         191 brick-makers, in both countries."313 The Response also states that the RRAP
         is independently monitored and evaluated on an annual basis.314

260.     OD 4.30 outlines the Bank policy objectives, the first of which is to avoid or
         minimize involuntary resettlement "where feasible."315 The directive provides
         that "[w]here displacement is unavoidable, resettlement plans should be
         developed. All involuntary resettlement should be conceived and executed as
         development programs, with resettlers provided sufficient investment resources
         and opportunities to share in project benefits [emphasis in original]. Displaced
         persons should be (i) compensated for their losses at full replacement cost prior
         to the actual move; (ii) assisted with the move and supported during the transition
         period in the resettlement site; and (iii) assisted in their efforts to improve their
         former living standards, income earning capacity, and production levels, or at
         least to restore them. Particular attention should be paid to the needs of the
         poorest groups to be resettled."316

261.     To analyze the claim that the Bank has not complied with OD 4.30, the Panel
         addresses separately two issues: compensation and resettlement. These issues are
         interrelated.

9.1. Compensation

262.     The Requesters claim that many people, particularly those living in barrio Santa
         Rosa, have been offered "negligible" amounts for their homes.

263.     Management summarizes its response to the charge that compensation levels are
         low as follows: "Home appraisal of affected houses is low because 87% of the
         people are occupants without titles that [sic] have small lots and shanty houses.
         This is why the RRAP provides land, housing and support at no cost to the
         families."317 Management indicates that "87 percent of affected urban families are
         occupants without titles of small lots with precarious houses that are located in
         areas with no running water, no sewerage lines, and no garbage collection."318
         The Response states that "a high percentage of the affected families have very low
         incomes."319 According to Management, a socioeconomic impact study financed
         under Loan 2854-AR "has found a situation of extreme poverty within the project
         area, with 50 percent of the population living below the poverty line."320 Under
         these circumstances, EBY compensated "[a]ll families resettled as part of Plans A
         and B, as well as those families in Itá Paso, Santa Rosa and Arroyo Porá" with

                                                                                                    82

         "properties and constructions that were above the replacement cost of their
         former lots and homes."321 Management states that in general the people had high
         levels of poverty and "the values of the properties they occupied were extremely
         low."322   However, Management maintains that where the replacement values
         were higher than the value of the houses EBY provided, the families received the
         monetary difference.323

264.     OD 4.30 expressly requires, as noted above, that displaced persons should be
         compensated for losses at full replacement cost and prior to their actual move.

9.1.1. Procedure for Valuation of Homes and of Property

265.     In the past, EBY employed a two-stage process to value homes and property: first
         a provisional or estimated appraisal and then a final appraisal at the time of
         expropriation. In response to difficulties associated with estimated appraisals,
         EBY has now abandoned the use of provisional appraisals. Under OD 4.30, the
         basic reference point, valuations must be "full replacement cost prior to the actual
         move."324    This is normally determined by reference to market value.        As is
         widely recognized, many difficulties plague market determination.

266.     The Panel visited the homes of many of the Requesters who had yet to be
         resettled and talked with their "coordinators" in areas around Encarnación.325
         Many of these houses were far from "shanty" houses, and the inhabitants
         consistently voiced their concerns that the house valuations EBY had provided
         them were low.        EBY informed the Panel that these evaluations should be
         considered "provisional" or "estimated" appraisals done prior to a finished
         worksheet and appraisal process; they have no status other than as preliminary
         information given to the owner.326 EBY also told the Panel that they had stopped
         using provisional evaluations because they caused so much misunderstanding.
         EBY officials insisted that at the time of the move (or expropriation of property)
         or when funds were available to offer people an early move, there would be a full,
         proper appraisal. The Panel was provided with examples of appraisal worksheets
         and finished appraisals for houses that had been purchased, as well as with a large
         document containing guidelines for appraisals.327

267.     Given what the Panel learned in sample interviews, it is very understandable that
         local people would often object to an "estimated appraisal", which even EBY
         officials would not defend and have stopped using. Because the movement of
         some of the people has been postponed or extended indefinitely pending the
         raising of the water level, the values of the homes and property are changing. In

        the absence of a final estimate for their properties, local people cannot seriously
        assess whether it would be better to take monetary compensation, take the house
        in the new settlement, or propose an alternative solution for an entire
        neighborhood of houses. Yet it is practically impossible for EBY to provide
        detailed appraisals until it is known when a group of houses will be moved.

268.    The terms of OD 4.30 are clear and require a "valuation procedure" applicable to
        the assets and the type of land tenure enjoyed by affected persons.328  The Panel
        finds that the use of provisional appraisals is not inconsistent with Bank
        policies. However, because affected people were not consulted and did not
        receive adequate information about the purpose and use of the provisional
        appraisals there has been considerable confusion. OD 4.30 calls for the Bank
        to monitor the actual appraisal values that will be paid when these properties
        are expropriated if the water level is raised.

9.1.2. Compensation for Usufruct or Customary Rights to Land and Loss of Access
to Resources and Public Services

269.    Many of the displaced people do not hold title to the land upon which their houses
        or resources are located. OD 4.30 requires that titled and untitled property should
        be treated as equally as possible in devising compensation rules.329 The first
        resettlement plan of 1979 to 1980 was not consistent with this requirement,
        because it made a strong distinction between those with formal title to their land
        and those merely occupying the land under a traditional system used in the area.
        By contrast, the 1992 resettlement plan provides for compensation to all displaced
        persons, regardless of whether they have title to their properties. The Panel finds
        that this provision in the 1992 resettlement plan is in compliance with the
        requirement of OD 4.30 regarding usufruct or customary rights to land.

270.    Loss of access to natural resources that must be compensated in this Project
        includes access to clay deposits. The Panel finds that to the extent that the
        resettlement plan provides for compensation for loss of access to these
        resources, the Bank is in compliance with the requirements of OD 4.30.
        However, as detailed in this report330 the procedures set forth by EBY for
        compensation may have resulted, in practical terms, in a denial of
        compensation to some affected people.

9.1.3. Compensation Prior to Displacement.

271.    OD 4.30 requires that full compensation be paid to displaced persons prior to their
        actual move. Not all persons flooded out of their property when the reservoir was




328OD 4.30, ¶ 17.

330See supra § 8.2.; supra § 10.


                                                                                        84

         raised in 1994 to the 76 masl level were properly compensated beforehand.331 In
         1997, Management assisted EBY in developing the so-called "Plan A" in part
         to compensate for this violation of OD 4.30.

272.     The Panel, however, found many instances in which people whose homes were
         flooded when the water level was raised in 1994, after Plan A was in effect, still
         feel inadequately compensated. In part this is because the grievance procedure in
         place at that time for people to object to the valuations offered for their property
         was inadequate. People without adequate resources to live when denied access to
         their property were asked either to accept the amount offered by EBY and in
         doing so agree to forego any further claim to additional funds, or to take the
         matter to court. If they took the matter to court, they would have no access to the
         funds until after a court decision. The Panel emphasizes that by accepting the
         payment offered and thus having access to the funds, a person had to sign that this
         was full valuation for the property lost. It is unreasonable for a person losing
         access to his/her home or livelihood resources by flooding to be given no better
         grievance procedure than taking the matter to court and to have no means of
         livelihood during the potentially protracted court battle.332

273.     Thus, as noted above, the Panel finds that the grievance procedures in effect
         during and since the time when the reservoir was raised to the 76 masl level
         were not in compliance with OD 4.30's requirement for fair compensation.333

274.     The Panel notes that for people whose property is to be expropriated at present,
         the new law governing expropriation that Paraguay adopted in January 2001 has
         set forth new expropriation procedures.334Under the new law, if people are offered
         compensation that they consider to be too low, they do not need to accept it in
         order to receive the funds during an appeal.                   EBY may pay the officially
         determined amount into an account in the name of the person to be compensated
         without obtaining that individual's agreement not to contest the amount. The
         period of time given to vacate the land starts on the date of the deposit. An


331Management Response to the first Request for Inspection submitted to the Inspection Panel in 1996 in
paragraph 1.8 states "We do not agree that the problems which have occurred and their possible
consequences for the local population are the result of any alleged Management violation of Bank policies
and procedures...all resettlement and environmental mitigation activities required prior to reaching the
current reservoir level of 76 masl have been met (except some pending matters which are being addressed
through appropriate financing and supervision)." (emphasis added)
332On several occasions during the Panel's visits, affected people told the Panel that EBY officers had
sometimes threatened that affected people will receive no compensation at all if they do not accept the
terms of compensation offered, saying that if their terms are not accepted, the families will not be
compensated at all, losing all their rights. The Panel was unable to verify this.

        individual contesting the amount in court would have access to the funds to
        subsist while the case is pending. The court could increase--but not decrease--
        the officially determined compensation. The Panel finds that the provision of
        the new law regarding access to funds during appeal is consistent with OD
        4.30.335 However, this provision, because it refers to judicial proceedings,
        does not provide an accessible, simple and effective grievance procedure
        available to affected people to settle disputes about these matters.

275.    The Panel discusses examples of failures to compensate particular groups of
        people for their losses at full replacement cost elsewhere in the report.

9.1.4. Sequencing of Places Selected for Compensation

276.    The Requesters have expressed concern that even while (from their perspective)
        there are still many "pending debts"336 owed to people who had to move from
        below the 78 masl level, EBY is picking and choosing properties between 78 and
        84 masl in a non-transparent process, and those properties are being compensated
        when their owners move. This concern applies both to houses and to businesses.

277.    The issue of the sequencing of those to be resettled also arises in the design and
        implementation of the Programa Desborde de Arroyos or Urban Creeks Program.
        As explained above,337 this program is in the process of voluntarily resettling
        affected people who live in areas between 78 and 84 masl and who are severely
        affected by the flooding of urban creeks. These individuals are already eligible
        for resettlement when and if the completion of the filling of the reservoir occurs.
        The Requesters criticize the selection of people under this program, alleging that
        it resulted in the resettlement of affected people who are not harmed by the
        creeks' flooding.

278.    The Panel saw many cases where some houses or businesses were missing on
        streets because individual plots had been vacated and the land was now owned by
        EBY, while other properties nearby were still occupied by their owners. The
        Requesters claim that, many other far more deserving people and neighborhoods,
        who are living in very difficult situations and want to move and be resettled, have
        not been able to obtain compensation or new homes.

279.    Bank and EBY staff told the Panel that, because the limited financing did not
        allow EBY to attend to all affected families, EBY tried to give priority to hardship
        cases, such as those who are elderly or infirm and need to sell their property in
        order to obtain money to treat their illnesses.338 In the area that is scheduled for



335There are a number of questionable aspects of the new expropriation law, as amended, about which the
Panel does not comment.

                                                                                                     86

         flooding, it is impossible to sell property other than to EBY. This is one of the
         problems arising from the long delay in raising the water level.

280.     OD 4.30 does not provide guidance regarding "fairness" in selecting a "proper"
         sequence of houses to be compensated, as long as all are adequately compensated
         in the course of the move. OD 4.30 does establish that the resettlement plan must
         be "time-bound,"339 and the presumption seems to be that, in whatever sequence
         the compensation and resettlement occurs, it will be done a this time-bound
         fashion and in consultation with those eligible for resettlement.

281.     When the presumption that resettlement will happen relatively quickly fails,
         the Bank Management needs to ensure, consistent with the purpose of OD
         4.30, that there is a rationale for resettlement sequencing and that the
         sequencing process is transparent and fair.

9.2. Resettlement

282.     The Panel has examined selected issues related to payment of compensation
         above. The following section considers selected claims and responses regarding
         the other option available to those who would be displaced, namely resettlement.
         Other sections of this report consider additional aspects of both options.

9.2.1. Alternative Sites

283.     The Requesters expressed to the Panel their concern that this Project failed in
         considering alternative resettlement sites. According to the Requesters, EBY has
         not gathered (through consultations with the population to be resettled) alternative
         ideas about the resettlement process and procedures.

284.     OD 4.30 states, "[t]he identification of several possible relocation sites and the
         demarcation of selected sites is a critical step for both rural and urban
         resettlement."340   Elsewhere, OD 4.30 also encourages the development of
         alternative designs through community participation341 and notes the importance
         for the resettlement plan of obtaining the eligible population's "attitudes on
         resettlement options."342

285.     The Panel met with some families who complained to the Panel that EBY offered
         only two options (resettlement within a developed resettlement site and payment
         of compensation) and did not consider the affected people's alternative proposals.
         These people showed the Panel copies of letters they had sent EBY proposing that
         they be allowed to purchase a site near their existing properties. They claim that
         this solution would be cheaper for EBY than the cost of the resettlement site

         houses, and would let them stay near their church and community. Some of these
         families could have relocated under the PDA program but refused to move in the
         hope of negotiating a better solution with EBY.343 However, according to the
         affected people, EBY responded that only the resettlement sites of Itá Paso and
         Arroyo Porá were available at that moment and that alternative sites could be
         considered if and when the water rises.344

286.     The Panel finds that the failure to consider acceptable resettlement
         alternatives is not consistent with OD 4.30.

9.2.2. Restoration of Income Earning Capacity

287.     The Requesters claim that inadequate programs were developed for the economic
         and productive rehabilitation of the affected families. Many affected families
         complained about a lack of training programs that could help them to restore their
         lost livelihoods or income.

288.     Management believes that the Requesters base their allegations on "incomplete
         and outdated information about the way the RRAP is structured and is currently
         operating," as, according to Management, the resettlement plan also includes a
         social and economic rehabilitation program.345

289.     Management Response states that "urban families relocated close to workplaces
         have generally recovered their former levels of income following resettlement."346
         Management acknowledges, however, that unexpected problems surfaced for
         many resettled people when the economic crisis hit Paraguay in 1996, because the
         1992 RRAP had not planned economic reestablishment for urban people. It also
         states that in 1992 "there was no evidence of loss of income in urban resettlements
         carried out by EBY."347          Presently, however, the people who live in areas
         relatively distant from the commercial center of Encarnación are having difficulty
         restoring their pre-resettlement incomes.348

290.     To address these problems, Management states that EBY and the GOP have
         designed a series of activities that include creation of a Productive Fund to
         support productive projects proposed by families and communities;349
         encouragement by EBY of private contractors under contract to EBY to promote
         employment of resettled families; subsidization of transport for families for the
         first six months after resettlement; design and development of family gardens;
         creation of a community plantation in Arroyo Porá; offer of training and capacity-
         building workshops for various trades (hairdresser, carpenter, electrician, etc.);

                                                                                             88

         and offer of free school and/or subsidized transportation for a certain period of
         time.350 With respect to peri-urban families, Management claims that the brick-
         makers have achieved "levels of productivity similar to or higher than those prior
         to resettlement," while the majority of rural families have "significantly improved
         living conditions and increased assets."351

291.     Bank policy on involuntary resettlement, OD 4.30, recognizes that normally
         "general economic growth cannot be relied upon to protect the welfare of the
         project-affected population." For that reason, "alternative employment strategies
         are needed for nonagricultural displaced people." This paragraph counsels that
         "[v]ocational    training, employment     counseling,     transportation   to   jobs,
         employment in the main investment project or in resettlement activities,
         establishment of industries, incentives for firms to locate in the area, credit and
         extension for small businesses or reservoir aquaculture, and preference in public
         sector employment should all be considered where appropriate."352

292.     The Request for Inspection and Requesters' discussions with the Panel refer to
         numerous specific examples where the productive infrastructure of subgroups of
         the resettled population has been damaged and no plans or inadequate plans are
         available to restore income level or infrastructure. For example, fishermen who
         were compensated were expected to retrain for other jobs.           However, they
         complained to the Panel that they were not provided with guidance or job-training
         opportunities. Brick-makers offer another example. According to the Requesters,
         many of them were inadequately compensated for their loss of access to high-
         quality clay deposits and were not given good opportunities for job retraining.

293.     The Requesters are also concerned about adequate transportation to reach their
         place of employment. While Management Response to the Request states that
         there is a plan for providing transportation for workers displaced by the Project,
         the Request for Inspection includes specific examples where such transportation is
         considered inadequate. An example is the municipal slaughterhouse workers
         (municipal employees of the city of Encarnación), who must arrive at the
         slaughterhouse so early in the morning that public transportation is not available.
         They are asking for compensation in the form of motorcycles or bicycles that
         would allow them to arrive on time or, in the case of older workers unable to
         reach the slaughterhouse at its new location, for suitable arrangements to retire.

294.     While recognizing that there have been commendable efforts to develop
         productive projects, the Panel finds that the measures for restoring income
         earning capacity have been inadequate. Some people were moved far from
         the market for their products and services, while others have found
         transportation to their place of work difficult and costly. Few of those who
         lost their livelihood have been offered adequate training to replace their lost

          source of income. The Panel recognizes that a severe economic crisis has
          occurred in the area. However, this does not negate the importance of
          restoring pre-resettlement income earning capacity with long-term measures
          rather than temporary solutions such as a temporary free transportation or
          five-year access to clay deposits. Thus the Panel finds that to the extent the
          measures are inadequate the Bank is not in compliance with OD 4.30.


 10. RESETTLEMENT AND COMPENSATIONOF SPECIFIC GROUPS: BRICK-MAKERS AND
                                    TILE-MAKERS (CERAMISTS)353


295.      The following section analyzes the claims related to a specific category of
          affected people: the brick-makers and the tile-makers. It first discusses the
          resettlement and rehabilitation options offered to small brick-makers and
          medium-to-large mechanized roof-tile makers.                   The report then focuses on
          compensation to the formal and informal workers.

296.      The Requesters complain that, while EBY provided compensation for several
          brick- and tile-making establishments, it relocated others to areas too far away
          from the clay deposits.          Moreover, when EBY paid such compensation, it
          benefited only the owners of the factories and neglected the personnel, leaving a
          large number of people without jobs. This caused many former employees to set
          up their own brick-making businesses. However, their current situation is very
          precarious because, as EBY owns the clay deposits, they must purchase the raw
          material from EBY or other landowners who still have their own clay supply and
          to pay a substantial amount for its transportation. The Request, therefore, urges
          the Bank to ask EBY to create programs for job retraining or support productive
          alternative activities for these affected individuals.354

297.      The Management Response lays out the options included in the resettlement plan
          that were offered to brick- and tile-makers. It also presents a summary of the
          number of brick and tile makers that were compensated and/or resettled during the
          period 1994 to 1996.355

298.      The Response states that the first option for small brick-makers included, among
          other things, a plot for a production unit, five years of clay trucked into the plot, a
          house plot, and a house with services such as water, electricity, drainage, and so
          forth. According to Management, this helped 97 resettled families to reestablish
          their brick-making businesses.           Of these, "92 now constitute the San Pedro
          Industrial Park in Encarnación... and 5 were re-established in Coronel Bogado
          Municipality."356 The Response also explains that the "majority of those


353 The terms "tile -makers", "roof-tile makers" and "ceramists" will be used interchangeably in this report
to indicate the same type of production unit.

         compensated were family owned businesses with some temporary or seasonal
         laborers."357 A 1993 study found "2.2 workers per brick making enterprise";
         according to the study, "the owner and a relative were the most common
         situation."358 Management further states that for those who did not continue their
         brick-making activity, EBY offered training courses "on various marketable
         skills."359 However, the Response adds, "the impact on employment has not been
         very significant due to the recession in the country and region."360

299.     As to the tile-makers, the options and rights of the industries' owners depended on
         whether the locations of their establishments and/or the clay deposits were above
         or below 84 masl.361 With respect to these industries' workers, Management
         maintains that those industries that had to relocate or that continued production in
         the same place "did not have to fire employees," and that "those that were
         compensated but did not continue production had to give workers severance pay
         as stipulated in Articles 78, 79, 80 and 91 of Law 213 (Work Code of the
         Paraguayan Republic, 1993...)."362             Accordingly, "the Bank as well as EBY
         worked under the assumption that Paraguayan labor laws would be applied
         effectively" and that "employers would proceed according to the law and properly
         compensate their employees."363

300.     Management acknowledges that "this assumption was optimistic, because the
         Bank supervision team assumed effective application of the law."364               In
         Management's view, however, "there are limits to how far EBY (and thus
         indirectly the Bank) can and should be required to monitor the ultimate use of the
         compensation paid."365

301.     In its Response, Management also states that "[t]he actions taken until 1996
         resolved all of the cases of brick factories below 84 masl (recorded in 1993), and
         included compensation to all those at higher levels who would be affected by
         subsequent lack of access to clay deposits, in accordance with OD 4.30 on
         Involuntary Resettlement."366

302.     The Bank policy on involuntary resettlement applicable to this project, OD 4.30,
         requires that all affected people who lose their sources of income as a result of a
         Bank-financed project be compensated for their losses, even in cases where they
         have not been physically displaced. The Panel addressed this issue in its Uganda
         investigation and concluded that:

              "A review of existing documentation on this issue reveals that the Bank has
              consistently taken the position that the compensation and rehabilitation called
              for under OD 4.30 extend not only to people physically displaced by a project
              but also to those who suffer other kinds of losses, such as the dismantling of
              production systems, the loss of productive assets or income sources, as well as
              any increased difficulties accessing, among other things, public services,
              customers and fishing and grazing.367 Paragraph 2 of OD 4.30 for example
              describes the severe social, economic, cultural and environmental problems
              which people may face as a consequence of development projects and
              paragraphs 11, 14 (c) and 15 address several factors that may disturb the
              resource base used by affected people: partial loss of assets that render
              households economically unviable and loss of access to, among other things,
              public services, customers, and fishing and grazing."368

303.     The Panel notes that, as early as 1997, in the context of its Review and
         Assessment of Action Plans of the Yacyretá Project, it urged the Bank to ensure
         that affected workers who lost their jobs as a result of the filling of the reservoir
         be directly compensated as required by Bank policy. At that time the Panel
         wrote:

              "It is a fact that clay deposits of the quality and amount of the deposits lost
              because of the reservoir elevation have not been found... and therefore it is
              difficult to accept that the workers lost their jobs because of a simple decision
              of owners of olerias to change economic activities. There seems to be enough
              prima facie evidence that the loss of jobs by brick factory workers has been
              caused mainly--if not directly--by the filling of the reservoir. If this is the
              case, the workers should be compensated according to Bank policy."369

10.1. Small-scale Brick-makers

304.     The Project's Resettlement and Rehabilitation Action Plan (PARR), approved by
         the Bank in 1992, identified industries dedicated to brick- and tile-making--
         commonly called oleros--among those that would be affected by the raising of


367This position has been articulated in internal Bank memoranda. See also Ibrahim Shihata, "Legal
Aspects of Involuntary Population Resettlement," in Anthropological Approaches to Resettlement: Policy,
Practice and Theory, ed. Michael Cernea and Scott Guggenheim (1991), and Ibrahim Shihata, ed., The
World Bank in a Changing World: Selected Essays (Martinus Nijhoff, 1991), 135­180. It should be noted,
however, that OP/BP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement (issued in December 2001) does not provide for
compensation of this type of loss because the new policy "covers direct economic and social impacts"
resulting in relocation, loss of assets or access to assets, or loss of income sources or means of livelihood
"caused by involuntary taking of land or the involuntary restriction of access to legally designated parks
and protected areas." OD/BP 4.12, ¶ 3.

          the reservoir.370 The PARR noted that many of the principal clay deposits on the
          Paraguayan side of the river would be flooded, particularly identifying the M'boi
          Caé neighborhood in Encarnación as one in which the majority of the families
          were involved in brick- or tile-making industries.371 The size of the production
          units ranged from small, family-run businesses to large, mechanized industries
          with salaried workers.372 Accordingly, the PARR determined that, because of the
          olerias families' different socioeconomic and cultural profiles, different solutions
          needed to be found for each subgroup of olerias families.373

305.      The issue of compensating medium and large industry owners, as distinct from
          artisanal brick- and tile-makers, was the subject of a meeting of EBY's Executive
          Directors on June 9, 1994. This meeting approved the "Policy Declaration for
          Encarnación," which offered solutions to compensate brick and tile industry
          owners on the Paraguayan side of the river.                   Priority was to be given to
          compensating the most vulnerable families--identified as mostly artisanal brick-
          makers--either through resettlement in areas above 84 masl or through assistance
          in changing their means of employment. On the other hand, the mechanized
          industry owners--identified as mostly roof-tile makers or ceramists--were
          deemed to have the resources and capacity necessary to reestablish themselves.

306.      The compensation provisions for brick-making industries are described in detail
          in the PARR and the aforementioned "Policy Declaration for Encarnación" and
          summarized in the Management Response.

307.      The Management Response lists four options for brick-makers (which according
          to the Bank were mostly small, family-owned businesses). Option 1 provided a
          house and a plot for a production unit, while Option 2 offered rural relocation
          with a plot of 7.5 hectares and a house in a new rural resettlement. This option
          enabled the brick-makers to receive technical agricultural assistance, social
          assistance, inputs for production, and food supply for six months. Option 3 was
          an urban house and compensation for a change of economic activity, and Option 4
          granted cash compensation.374 The Management Response additionally notes that
          many brick-makers above the 84 masl line had also demanded compensation
          based on lost access to clay obtained from areas that were about to become
          flooded by the Project.375




370 RRAP, 34. The PARR identified 245 olerías families in Paraguay that would be affected by the raising
of the reservoir, 70 of which were artisanal and 175 of which were semi-mechanized. (Note that "the
figures do not include rural olería families on the Paraguayan bank, for which clear information is not
available.") Ibid., 93. 27 percent of brick- and tile-making families had title to the land on which their
industries were located, while 73 percent were occupants.

308.     The compensation options for small brick-makers are also discussed in an article
         authored by the Bank consultant who helped develop the resettlement plan, María
         Clara Mejía.376 Her study distinguishes five options, only three of which were
         available for small brick-makers in Paraguay.

309.     In the first of the three options EBY gave the oleros private plots without clay, but
         supplied them with riverbank material. This option was used at the San Pedro
         resettlement site. The second option involved brick-makers and their production
         units at San Cosme y Damian and at Coronel Bogado, Paraguay. These oleros
         were given communal clay deposits and equipment to be managed through legal
         cooperative arrangements. In these cases, a cooperative association was
         established. Ten hectares of communal clay deposits were to be used on a quota
         basis by the cooperative members, and two trucks and a tractor were provided to
         haul clay to individually owned production units.

310.     The Panel found in its visits to the San Pedro resettlement site that while
         families had reestablished their brick-making activities, many complained
         about losses in their income level and about the lack of continued access to
         raw material at a reasonable cost because the five-year clay supply had
         ended.

311.     The third option for small artisanal brick-makers included cash compensation.
         This provided a cash sum based on "production capacity" as well as a house and
         plot. The cash compensation option was not recommended in the resettlement
         plan, but nevertheless "it was expected that a small number of families, because of
         age, health problems, shortage of family labor, and so on, were not going to
         continue the activity...[and thus]...would only settle for cash compensation."377
         In practice, however, the number of families who chose cash compensation was
         substantial.   378   This option also encouraged more people to settle in the area and
         to begin small brickworks in the hope of receiving additional cash compensation
         before the reservoir level was raised.

378Ibid. The article notes that studies of people who received compensation showed that 30 percent of those
compensated at San Cosme used the money to pay previous debts; 30 percent used the money to buy food
and cover other immediate needs; only a few invested in restoring their brick-making production; and some
simply deposited the money in interest-bearing accounts in a bank that failed, thus losing the money
entirely. Of those who were compensated and used up or lost all their money without investing in restoring
their brick-making capacity, some were (in 2000) working as paid labor in the relocated olerias, while
others have returned to the banks of the river, "in the area already cleared [for flooding], hoping for a
second resettlement package." Ibid., 158­9. Mejía concludes, "[D]uring the 12-year resettlement process,
the implementing agency lost credibility in the eyes of the affected population because of mounting delays.
Political opportunists at all levels (sometimes even involving local nongovernmental organizations) sought
to exploit the fear and distrust of the oleros. The binational agreement favored different treatment of
similar problems, creating inconsistencies in the rehabilitation process...." Ibid., 160.

10.2. Medium- and Large-Size Industries

312.    EBY identified medium and large industries in the project area, mostly roof-tile
        makers. The 1992 PARR that the Bank approved did not consider resettlement as
        an alternative for large industries, because it was considered that they had the
        capacity to relocate on their own to a site of their own choosing, if they were
        provided indemnification for the property lost. According to Management, the
        PARR proposed solutions to permit the industries to continue their production,379
        which EBY was required to implement pursuant to the Project's legal agreements.

313.    In the "Policy Declaration for Encarnación," EBY laid out the following
        compensation alternatives for the roof-tile industry owners:

        (i) Establishments located above 83 masl, which owned lands with clay deposits
             below 83 masl would receive payment for those lands. If the establishment
             used clay from lands it did not own, it would be remunerated for the cost of a
             five-year supply of clay, with due regard to the establishment's customary
             production levels.
        (ii) Establishments located below 83 masl, would receive payment for the
             establishment, the land on which the establishment was located, if owned, and
             any additional property containing clay deposits owned by the establishment.
             If lands containing clay deposits were not owned, payment would be provided
             exclusively for the improvements. If the establishment chose to self-relocate,
             it would receive, in addition to payment for improvements, remuneration for
             the cost of a five-year supply of clay in accordance with the establishment's
             customary production levels.

314.    The conclusions of the "Policy Declaration" were refined, with administrative
        procedures regulating their application, by EBY Resolution No. 2824/95, dated
        September 28, 1995, which established an alternative compensation solution for
        roof-tile industries, so-called "self-relocation." EBY considered that this solution
        would allow the industries to continue their production, would avoid
        unemployment, and was also consistent with the Paraguayan Expropriation Law
        No. 394/94.380

315.    Under the self-relocation proposal, production would be relocated to a nearby site
        and the owner would receive, inter alia, payment for the property value and
        replacement costs of improvements, payment for the machinery of equipment that
        could not be transferred, and "recognition of the value of severance payments that
        the roof-tile owner should provide to personnel that did not relocate to the new

         establishment, in accordance with the employment and accounting registers that
         the industry owner was legally required to maintain."381

316.     In its Response, Management states that an independent evaluation from 1997 to
         1998 found that of the roof-tile industries, thirteen had relocated and eleven of
         them continued their activity, sixteen industries continued their production in the
         same spot where they were before, and twenty-five had been discontinued.382

317.     The Panel finds that the industry owners could be expected to make an
         informed decision of the value and prospects of their clay deposits and to be
         able to choose freely whether to accept the compensation package offered.
         However, the Panel expresses concerns about the adequacy of the provision of a
         "five-year supply of clay in accordance with the establishment's customary
         production levels," as this appears to be a temporary measure rather than a long-
         term solution.

10.3. Compensation to Workers of Brick- and Tile-making Industries

318.     The Request for Inspection claims that although EBY compensated the owners of
         brick and tile making industries, it neglected to pay the workers.

10.3.1. Rules and Procedures

319.     As mentioned above, Management Response to the Request emphasized that the
         workers' compensation is a responsibility of the employers, not of EBY. In fact,
         the Management Response claims, the industries' owners who "were
         compensated but did not continue production had to give workers severance pay"
         in accordance with Paraguayan labor laws.383

320.     On several occasions during the investigation the Panel requested Management to
         clarify this issue, both in general and with reference to specific cases of employers
         and employees who alleged they had not received any form of compensation. As
         a result, Management sent to the Panel a number of memoranda384 containing
         detailed information regarding compensation, mainly concerning the cases of
         large, mechanized roof-tile makers.

321.     The different memoranda include seemingly conflicting assertions with regard to
         EBY's obligation to compensate employers for the severance pay owed to the
         workers. In an April 2003 memorandum, Management states that "compensation
         to roof-tile employees who did not continue working with a self-relocated industry
         or whose labor contract was rescinded was recognized under [EBY's] Resolution

382Management Response, ¶ 134.
383Ibid., ¶ 135; see also supra ¶ 299.
384Management sent the Panel memoranda on April 22, 2003; May 13, 2003; July 8, 2003; December 22,
2003; January 13, 2004; and January 14, 2004 (two Memoranda).


                                                                                                96

         2824/95."385 It adds that, in 2001, EBY stated that it had received claims from
         211 employees who had worked in industries below 84 masl whose employers
         were relocated via self-relocation, and from seven workers whose employer had
         been compensated via indemnification.386 Management states that "both...were
         compensation methods [self-relocation and indemnification] that recognized
         severance payments to personnel whose contracts were terminated."387 By
         contrast, in May 2003, a subsequent memorandum stated that "although EBY
         quite correctly provided compensation for the costs of industry relocation, it does
         not logically follow that EBY would have to extend this compensation to cover
         severance payments to employees terminated because of an owner's choice not to
         pursue the available self-relocation option."388            Similarly, in a memorandum
         dated July 8, 2003, Management claims that under the self-relocation framework,
         "EBY provided severance compensation only to those industry workers who were
         not able to relocate with the industry. No compensation was provided to those
         workers who had lost their jobs due to the closing of an enterprise, as the
         compensation strategy was designed to promote continuation of production."389

322.     The Panel notes that apparently only after the submission of the second Request
         for Inspection and the Panel's repeated requests for additional information and
         clarifications in relation to the compensation of the workers did Management look
         more deeply into the rights and obligations of EBY, if any, vis-à-vis the
         employees of the brick- and tile-making industries.

323.     To address the Panel's requests for clarifications, Management requested a
         Paraguayan law firm, Estudio Mersan Abogados, to prepare a legal review and
         analysis of Paraguayan law to determine, inter alia, the rights of the workers vis-
         à-vis their employers and with respect to EBY. The Bank's request for the legal
         opinion defined the term "worker" as "an employee who has a written contractual
         labor relationship with his/her employer" and "an employee who does not have a
         written contractual relationship but received salary compensation for work done
         (i.e. informal employee)."390

324.     The legal opinion analyzed the employers' and EBY's obligations and the rights
         of the workers under both Paraguay's labor code and civil code. The review
         determined that, in case of business closure, the employer owes the employees
         severance payments, the amount of which is established based on the labor code's
         provisions.    These payments are due to both formal and informal workers,
         because the worker is not responsible for the employer's negligence in

         maintaining the records. Informal workers, however, need to prove in court their
         work relationship should the employer dispute their rights. In the specific case of
         the self-relocation option, the opinion states that, while the workers have a right to
         sue their employer if they have not received severance pay, no provision gives
         them standing in court against EBY because the obligation EBY assumed to
         compensate the employer for the cost of the employees' severance payment stems
         from a contract between EBY and the employer. According to the legal opinion,
         EBY has no direct obligation to compensate the workers.391

325.     In terms of the amount of compensation to industry owners, EBY officials told the
         Panel during its visits that EBY calculates the value of severance payments to the
         workers based on the employer's declaration regarding the number and status of
         employees in his firm. The owner is to pay the properly registered workers their
         severance payments, which EBY would subsequently reimburse up to an amount
         listed as a separate line item on the worksheets that detail the compensation owed
         to the industry owner.         Such reimbursement is, however, conditional on the
         employer's provision of evidence that each employee has been properly registered
         and his/her social security taxes paid.392

326.     During the course of its investigation, the Panel repeatedly requested the Bank for
         information on EBY's procedures to compensate the owners and received
         conflicting statements from both Management and EBY. The Panel notes that
         EBY officials clearly described this reimbursement procedure to the Panel team
         only during its December 2003 visit.

327.     In fact, during a meeting with several EBY officials, in January 2003, EBY's then
         legal advisor in Paraguay told the Panel that EBY paid compensation to each
         employer in one installment.               The total amount received included the
         compensation for the employer's assets or other rights as well as the amount
         necessary to pay the workers' compensation. The employer was then obligated,
         under Paraguayan labor law, to pay severance payments to the terminated
         employees. Under such circumstances, therefore, after EBY paid the owner the
         total amount of compensation in accordance with the law, whether the employer
         in turn paid its workers was outside of EBY's responsibilities. The Management
         Response seems to confirm this when it states that "there are limits to how far
         EBY (and thus indirectly the Bank) can and should be required to monitor the
         ultimate use of the compensation paid."393 Statements of this nature have given



391Management Memorandum, May 13, 2003. In a very exceptional case, however, the worker, like any
other creditor who is owed an amount certain and immediately enforceable ("suma liquida y exigible"),
could subrogate the owner and sue EBY in lieu of his/her employer for the compensation he has a right to,
provided that he can prove that the employer has been negligent or not acted against EBY to obtain or
collect any compensation owed to the employer under the expropriation law. This action would be the
subject of a very lengthy and complex civil procedure, which normally would not be affordable to a
worker.

        the Requesters the impression that the owners were retaining the money that
        EBY paid them to compensate their employees even if not the case.

10.3.2. Compensation Programs

328.    The Panel's visits to the project area, the review of the documents, and the
        interviews with Bank staff all revealed that a large number of workers who lost
        their source of income as a consequence of the Yacyretá Project belong to the
        category of informal workers, for whom employers did not keep official
        employment records or pay social security taxes. The Panel finds that the Bank
        should have taken this fact into account when it reviewed and approved the
        Project's resettlement programs.

329.    EBY's procedures to reimburse the employer for the severance payments awarded
        to the former employees require verification of whether the employer submitted
        the correct employment records. On this basis, Management maintains that EBY
        reviewed the claims it received from some employees and concluded in most
        cases that the industry workers were ineligible for compensation. For example, an
        EBY Memorandum dated February 27, 2001 states, based upon the examination
        of documentation for 430 roof-tile workers claiming to be affected by the
        reservoir rising, "[N]one of the workers possessed a card from the Institute of
        Social Benefits nor an employment contract registered with the Ministry of
        Labor."394 EBY further concludes that, from the documents reviewed, "none of
        the tile-making employees from the industries located below 84 masl that received
        self-relocation compensation could be considered affected on the basis of
        Resolution 2824/95."395

330.    Based on the foregoing, the Panel finds that the large number of informal
        workers who worked in large, mechanized industries as well as in small-scale
        brick-making facilities were in practice excluded from the compensation
        system that the Bank approved, even though they suffered the adverse
        impacts of the project. They therefore had to rely on their employer complying
        with the law and/or the court recognizing their status and rights.

    A Brick-worker Waits At M'boi Caé

    Leaning on a shade tree next to the simple wooden shed he uses to store bricks near his home
    at M'boi Caé, Mr. A,1 aged 49, displays the census documents showing he lived here in M'boi
    Caé in 1980 and also in 1990. He is one of the former brick industry employees now seeking
    compensation for their loss of employment in M'boi Caé's brick making industries. Besides
    being an "affected person" due to his loss of employment, he is also "affected" in another way,
    because he resides in the area that will be flooded when the water rises to 83 meters above sea
    level (masl). Mr. A explains that, "until the water rose" [to 76 masl, in 1994], there were many
    brick- and tile-making industries at M'boi Caé. But they all closed down and moved away
    when the riverbank areas from which they got their clay was flooded, and Mr. A lost his
    employment So he has turned to making his own bricks, using clay he purchases by the
    truckload from nearby Pacu Cúa. Asked about what company he worked for and whether that
    company compensated him, he points out that since there were over 50 brick working
    industries here in M'boi Caé, he worked for many of them. There was no shortage of work
    precisely because there were so many employers. So, like many of his neighbors, Mr. A was
    an informal worker, not an employee of just one firm. Recently, Mr. A has joined a group of
    former brick industry workers demanding compensation.

     1Mr. A is a fictitious name.




331.   Under Paraguayan law and EBY policy, formal workers--for whom employers
       kept appropriate employment records and paid social security contributions--who
       did not relocate with the roof-tile industry had a right to receive severance
       payment, and their employers were to be compensated for such payments.
       However, the amount of the employer's compensation was determined
       unilaterally by EBY based on the information initially provided by the employer.
       EBY staff stated that this determination was not subject to revision even when
       there was a court judgment providing higher amounts of compensation to the
       workers.

332.   Under such circumstances, the Panel wishes to emphasize that it is a matter
       of considerable concern that the Bank would accept, in a notoriously weak
       institutional setting, a compensation system that is based on the "assumption
       that Paraguayan labor laws would be applied effectively" by employers.396 The
       system essentially penalizes the workers because, if the employer has not
       complied with all legal and social securities obligations, it does not provide
       any compensation to the workers.

333.   The Panel is troubled that the Bank approved compensation procedures whereby
       workers must go to court to enforce their rights if their employer does not follow
       the law and have no effective recourse against EBY. In this respect, the Panel
       observes that the law firm, which prepared the legal opinion upon Management's
       request acknowledges that even though it is legally possible for the employees to
       subrogate a passive owner and sue EBY, that option is not a simple lawsuit but
       one with a restricted scope and an ample range of defenses available to EBY. In

                                                                                                    100

          addition, based on the Treaty,397 the workers would also have to travel from
          Encarnación to Asunción, Paraguay--five hours away--to file and follow such a
          lawsuit.

334.      Based on the foregoing, the Panel finds that the compensation program
          approved by the Bank was not consistent with OD 4.30 because it excluded in
          practice compensation for a specific category of economic losses that affected
          one of the poorest segments of the area population--that is, the informal
          workers of the brick- and tile-making industries.

335.      A specific case the Panel investigated illustrates these observations.398 The Panel
          received detailed information about the workers of a large roof-tile industry in
          Encarnación, whose owner--hereinafter referred to as "Family A"--rejected the
          self-relocation option and shut down the factory.

336.      Because of Family A's decision to close down the tile making business, EBY
          conducted expropriation proceedings. The Panel reviewed the appraisal
          documents and EBY's Resolution authorizing the compensation payments to
          Family A.399 The Panel learned that EBY paid one member of Family A
          US$1,289,620 for his ceramics firm and paid US$1,450,419 for his and other
          family members' lands that contained clay deposits. These amounts together
          totaled US$2,740,039. According to the appraisal worksheet, EBY also estimated
          the amount Family A owed to the factory's workers as severance payments, but
          the worksheet indicated that "the amount of Gs. 100,250,268 [about US$50,000]
          for the indemnification of workers of the tile-making industry" was "not included"
          in the total.400 This means that Family A was to pay the workers their severance
          payments and submit to EBY the required documentation in order to recover
          those payments.

337.      The Panel interviewed one member of Family A who was accompanied by the
          family's attorney.401 The Panel learned that, after the roof-tile industry shut down,
          the former employees brought a lawsuit against Family A for severance payments.
          The judge awarded the workers a total amount of approximately US$80,000.


397Tratado de Yacyretá, Article XIX(1).
398Aside from the specific cases explained below in this report, there are others where the employer did not
receive compensation for workers. or example, in a January 14, 2004 memorandum to the Panel,
Management describes the case of an owner that received a compensation of PYG 304,689,212 to self-
relocate his industry and later an additional amount of PYG. 4,705,331 to account for exchange rate
differences. The owner had to make severance payments to his workers totaling PYG 100,609,500 but
received no compensation from EBY because he did not submit the required documentation that would
entitle him to reimbursement under EBY's resolution 2824/95. EBY refused to compensate him in spite of
the fact that he had submitted the employees' resignation letters and corresponding payments receipts,
together with an affidavit by the workers' attorney stating that the employees were indeed paid the amount
shown in the receipts.
399EBY, Resolution No. 2916/96, January 11, 1996 and Resolution 686/96.
400This would equal US$50,760 at the exchange rate of PYG 1975 = US$1 in effect at the time of the
assessment, on September 6, 1995.

         After paying this amount, Family A contacted EBY to obtain the reimbursement;
         the Panel viewed at least two letters to EBY requesting reimbursement. EBY
         never reimbursed Family A because, EBY officials and Management claim,
         adequate employment records were never presented.402

338.     The Panel has received a report on legal complaints against another roof-tile
         industry, hereinafter referred to as "Industry B", owned by "Owner B", which
         raises a different issue. These are legal cases brought by workers of a tile-making
         industry that was compensated for its loss of access to clay in flooded areas
         (though the industry itself was not flooded because it is located above 84 masl).
         Owner B states that EBY paid him an amount to allow him to continue his
         activity and also provided access to different clay deposits. Owner B, however,
         found he was unable to keep his tile-making industry profitable in the new
         environment after losing access to the higher-quality clay, and he therefore had to
         furlough workers. This resulted in lawsuits in which the workers claim as
         compensation a sum greater than the entire amount he had been awarded by EBY
         for his losses resulting from the Project.403

339.     A citation from the petition of Owner B will illustrate the problems this situation
         poses, in terms that put the application of the Bank's social safeguard policies in
         human context:

             "The Yacyretá Bi-National Entity gave to Owner B the sum of Gs. 476,449,636 (four hundred
             seventy-six million, four hundred forty-nine thousand, six hundred thirty-six guaraníes), per
             the Agreement for payment of Ceramicists located above the 83 Water Level, based on
             Resolution No. 3195/97, which supposes a technological retrofitting for processing different
             clay and a recognition of greater transportation distance for ten years. Nevertheless, with the
             receipt of money they give us responsibility for the promise to continue working and to give
             guarantees to the personnel connected to the establishment, and exempting Yacyretá from all
             responsibility to the workers of the affected [party]. The payments, in that moment, were made
             with much haste, and we were without the opportunity to analyze the consequences of what
             we were signing. [...]

             We have invested in the retrofitting of our factory, improving our Installations and Machines,
             and have roamed through many places to carry good clay from distances up to 80 Km. All
             was in vain; we could not produce at acceptable costs to provide our local markets and
             [those] of Misiones, Argentina. As a consequence, we remain without economic means, after
             negotiating the voluntary retirements with compensation of eleven of our workers, leaving
             fifteen of them working. With the intention of salvaging this situation, and supported by the
             labor laws in our country, we solicited a labor suspension in our Factory for fifteen days,
             which opportunity our workers took to demand of us, as compensation for unjustified
             dismissal, the sum of Gs. 495,000,000 (four hundred ninety-five million guaraníes).
             Appearing in all of the instances as a documentary basis for the demands, is the EBY
             Agreement for payment to Owner B.

             I have already paid a sum greater than Gs. 300,000,000 (three hundred million guaraníes), in
             compensations, and I have yet to pay eight of the workers with the most seniority whose sums
             I don't know because they are waiting for [a] Resolution by the Supreme Court of the

              Republic of Paraguay. I wish to say only that in payment of compensation to my workers I
              have spent more money than the total that EBY gave me for losses on my factory.

              Now my factory has turned into ruins. I am a man of 65 years. These circumstances oblige me
              to sell a house, a rural tract of land belonging by inheritance to my wife, the family car.... I
              run the risk of losing the home that I built forty years ago and where all of my children were
              born and raised.

              I have been through very difficult times in terms of my health: an open heart surgery that
              resulted in two by-passes; and a prostate operation detecting a second-degree cancer that,
              according to periodic examinations, thanks to God, appears to have been cured.

              This is the actual situation of a man who, being a worker for 25 years, started a small Factory
              with much effort and dedication. I feel proud of having manufactured for many years if not
              the best, some of the best roof tiles and bricks in the area."404

340.     The Panel is surprised to read in documents provided to the Panel by
         Management that "[t]o the extent that we are aware, there has not been a
         single legally recognized claim by a terminated employee against his or her
         employer."405 Many claims brought by terminated employees against their
         employers were brought to the attention of the Panel on its visits.406

341.     Finally, since OD 4.30 calls for compensation of all losses resulting from
         involuntary resettlement, the Panel finds that Management's statements, included
         in the May 2003 and July 2003 memoranda, that roof-tile industries' owners
         would not recover severance payments made to their workers, regardless of the
         workers' legal status, because "[n]o compensation was provided tothose workers

406The Panel notes, however, that in a January 14, 2004, Memorandum to the Panel, Management refers to
the situation of a tile industry owner whose employees filed a law suit against him to obtain the severance
payments owed to them.


                                                                                                        103

         who had lost their jobs due to the closing of an enterprise, as the compensation
         strategy was designed to promote continuation of production" is inconsistent with
         the Bank's resettlement policy.407 This strategy does not maintain employment
         sources.

10.3.3. Access to Clay Deposits

342.     The Requesters acknowledge that EBY compensated a large number of brick-
         makers and ceramists but allege that many of these people had to relocate to areas
         that are too far from clay deposits. As a result, this group of affected people now
         lives under difficult economic conditions because EBY allegedly owns the clay
         deposits and the people are forced to buy raw material from EBY or from others
         who still own their land. The Requesters therefore ask that a program of income
         restoration be put in place for these families.

343.     The Management Response claims that the relocation option offered to the
         displaced persons included, inter alia, a plot for a production unit, five years of
         clay trucked into the plot, social and technical assistance, and a grant of US$2,500
         for lost time.408     Management claims that "[t]he great majority of those
         compensated were family owned businesses with some temporary or seasonal
         laborers...For those who selected cash compensation, EBY began in 1994 to offer
         training courses to the brick makers through the Servicio Nacional de Promoción
         Profesional. These courses on various marketable skills were very well attended,
         but the impact on employment has not been very significant due to the recession
         in the country and region."409

344.     The Bank policy on involuntary resettlement, OD 4.30, establishes that land,
         housing, infrastructure, and other compensation should be provided to populations
         who may have usufruct or customary rights to land or access to other resources
         taken by the project, regardless of the absence of legal title to land by such
         groups.410 In addition (and as noted above in Section 9.2.2) OD 4.30 establishes
         the importance of vocational training and similar initiatives for displaced people
         who lose their livelihood.411

345.     The Panel finds that the Bank-approved provision of five years access to clay
         has not fully met OD 4.30's requirement that project-affected people have
         their pre-resettlement income earning capacity improved or at least restored.
         In stating this, the Panel recognizes that a severe economic crisis has
         occurred in the area. Although there have been efforts to retrain the brick-
         makers for other vocations, the Panel finds that for many people their
         income earning capacity seems not to have been restored.

                         11. ADEQUACY OF THE RESETTLEMENT PLAN


346.     Bank policy on involuntary resettlement applicable to the Yacyretá Project, OD
         4.30, provides that, when large-scale displacement of populations cannot be
         avoided, such displacement should proceed based on a detailed resettlement plan,
         a timetable, and a budget, all aimed at improving or at least restoring the
         economic base for those relocated.412

347.     In 1992 the Bank required implementation of a new resettlement policy, which
         led to the second "Resettlement and Rehabilitation Action Plan" (PARR), the
         resettlement plan now being implemented. Only the population registered in the
         census of 1989 to 1990 (the so-called "1990 census") was eligible for Bank
         compensation or resettlement.413 According to this PARR, all affected people,
         regardless of tenure, were entitled to a new plot and house at no cost--terms
         consistent with OD 4.30 and also much better (for the majority of non-titled
         residents) than those that had been offered under the original relocation plan of
         1979. The PARR distinguished between urban and rural resettlement populations
         and sites. Ninety-two percent of the population to be resettled under this plan was
         urban, and eighty-seven percent lacked titles to their homes.414

348.     The Panel finds that the Bank approved a detailed resettlement plan,
         timetable, and budget for this project aimed at improving or at least
         restoring the economic base for those relocated. Thus, in this sense the Bank
         was in compliance with the requirement of OD 4.30. However, the plan,
         budget, and particularly the timetable envisaged within that plan have not
         worked as originally intended, creating a compliance issue for other aspects
         of this OD.

349.     In accordance with the Third Owners' Agreement, the status of the "extra-census"
         population, those that arrived after the 1990 census, is that the governments of
         Paraguay and Argentina will fund their resettlement or compensation, each
         government funding the extra-census resettlement projects for its residents.415
         This is in accordance with OD 4.30.

412OD 4.30, ¶ 4.
413Management Response, ¶ 43.
414Ibid., ¶ 119.
415The "Third Owners' Agreement" between Argentina, Paraguay, and the Bank, as amended in 1997
when the legal agreements for Loans 2854-AR and 3520-AR were updated, established that any family not
included in the 1990 census and living in areas up to 84 masl ("post-census families") would be resettled
and/or compensated by the governments of the respective countries with their own funds.


                                                                                                       105

350.     OD 4.30 requires that under Bank-approved resettlement plans, the affected area
         and the displaced population be identified. The host government should develop
         mechanisms to prevent "illegal encroachers and squatters" from participating in
         the benefits and compensation arrangements.416 Clearly that has not happened in
         this case. One reason is the lack of an adequate expropriation law in Paraguay.
         Paraguay allegedly did not have the power to expropriate all land to be flooded
         under the Project and to prevent people from settling on it because the original
         expropriation law was limited to properties within the area to be flooded up to
         76masl. This permitted a great increase in population, and thus increased the
         number of claimants who now need to be resettled (the increase began after the
         1980 census and has continued to the present). In December 2003, EBY
         confirmed to the Panel that, to their knowledge, no other legal method existed (for
         example, residence permits) that could have been used to prevent this influx.

351.     There has also been a large increase in people with minimal connections to the
         area. In a poor region where many people have few other alternatives, there is
         considerable attraction in becoming eligible for compensation or for a new house,
         by moving to the area about to be flooded. During site visits, for example, the
         Panel met with an association of brick-workers who felt that they had been
         unfairly denied compensation but also admitted that many of them had recently
         come to the area seeking work. In other cases, people were attracted to the area
         by the work offered by the hydroelectric project itself. The large number of
         people left unemployed at Ayolas after the hydroelectric dam works had been
         completed is a case in point. The Panel was informed that some of these people
         had been living in the area long enough to be included in later censuses (including
         the 1990 census) as affected persons.417

352.     OD 4.30 notes that socioeconomic surveys, such as the census, should be
         conducted as early as possible "to prevent inflows of population ineligible for
         compensation."418 OD 4.30 also requires a "clear understanding of the legal
         issues involved in resettlement" in order "to design a feasible resettlement plan.
         An analysis should be made to determine the nature of the legal framework for the
         resettlement envisaged, including (a) the scope of the power of eminent
         domain."419

353.     The Panel finds that within the prevailing legal setting the resettlement plan
         as designed could not prevent the influx of ineligible population, because the
         legal framework was inadequate for this purpose. The Panel finds that the
         analysis of legal issues in resettlement, including analysis of the power of

        eminent domain either did not occur or was inadequate at the time the Bank
        approved the resettlement plan. This is not in compliance with OD 4.30.420

11.2. Delays and Uncertainties

354.    An issue of broad concern is that the long-term delays in raising the reservoir's
        water levels have caused an extraordinary amount of uncertainty among affected
        people.421 These delays are the source of problems and serious hardship for many
        people left "in limbo" (as some Bank staff described it in interviews with the
        Panel). They do not know if and when they will be resettled; they are unable to
        sell or expand their properties; and in many ways they have to adjust what would
        be a normal social organization of their households in order to remain eligible for
        compensation. This has occurred despite the requirement of OD 4.30 that any
        resettlement plan accepted by the Bank be "time-bound."422

355.    The inadequacy of the existing resettlement plan (of 1992) for handling lengthy
        delays is mainly due to the fact that it was designed for the relatively speedy
        raising of the water level of the reservoir to 83 masl. The initially planned phased
        reservoir filling schedule was to raise the water from its normal 68 masl level to
        76 masl for one year beginning in 1994, then to 78 masl in 1995 for three years,
        and then to the full 83 masl by 1998.423 The water is currently at 76 masl. To
        raise the water to this height and provide for a buffer area, all evictions have taken
        place to the 78 masl level.424 However, the reservoir has had to remain at the 76
        masl height since 1994, leaving a large population that lives between 78 and 84
        masl (the latter figure includes a 1 masl buffer zone above the 83 masl water
        level) with the hardship of uncertainty for which they have received no
        compensation other than the promise or hope of possible resettlement (or cash
        compensation in lieu of resettlement) at some uncertain future date.

356.    As will be detailed more fully below, this long-term uncertainty (at least ten years
        so far, and an unknown amount of time to come) leaves the large population that
        has long been awaiting resettlement with losses and hardships. The Panel met
        many people who are unable to sell homes or property in the area scheduled for
        flooding but not yet flooded, as buyers can seldom be found for property that may
        or may not be flooded in the future. These people are unsure whether they will be
        compensated for improvements or additions to their already-surveyed homes,
        including "normal" changes they would make to accommodate their growing
        families.425 If they had certainty as to how many years they would be able to
        occupy their homes, they could make informed decisions about whether it is

       worthwhile to invest in improvements, even if they would not be compensated for
       them.

357.   The Panel also met many people who dare not move away for fear of losing their
       right to future compensation. In some cases, elderly parents remained living with
       many married children and their families in the same house, rather than have
       grown children risk losing their status as part of the original resettlement-eligible
       household by moving out or building another house of their own. Many of the
       most heart-rending cases of poverty and also anger on the part of the affected
       people who talked with the Panel were those who had been approved for
       resettlement but are currently unable to be resettled until the project proceeds with
       raising the water level at some unknown date in the future.




    Waiting in Barrio Santa Rosa

    Mr. B,1 83 years old, and his wife, 80 years old, have lived in their house in Barrio Santa Rose for
    38 years. They are above the 78 meter level, but will be included in the expropriations when the
    water rises to 83 meters above sea level (masl). Like many others who live in Barrio Santa Rosa,
    they feel that the urban flooding they experience is directly related to the raising of the water level
    (a claim reflected in the Request for Inspection). They would very much like to get an advanced
    indemnification for their home and move out of the area under the Urban Creeks Program (PDA).
    They are worried that, if their compensation is delayed, they will die before the compensation
    arrangements are made, leaving the matter unfinished and eligibility (or access to their
    compensation) in question for their children. They have been sending to EBY medical information
    about their illnesses. Mr. B has been unable to work at his carpentry profession since 1977. Their
    son, has "replaced" the father as a carpenter by building a new carpentry shop in the yard of his
    parents' home. So when the property is expropriated, the value of the plot of land and house will go
    to Mr. B's parents, and a separate indemnification for the value of his own "improvement" on the
    property (that is, his carpentry shop) will go to their son. But the son complains that ever since the
    water rose to 78 m, they have been trying to make a living while awaiting expropriation, however,
    there is much less work for carpenters because so many people have already left in the first round
    of expropriations to the 78 m level. Mr. and Mrs. B, as well as their other children have not moved
    out because they fear losing their status as affected persons. The whole family has been waiting for
    the expropriation of this house in order to move to a new home near their daughter's home. Though
    their current house is in an area that will be flooded, it had a central location and, they insist, a high
    value in the past, when this was considered a good neighborhood of Encarnación, before the recent
    frequent flooding. Mr. and Mrs. B say they would like to have sold their home already and moved,
    but since all potential buyers know that this area could be flooded any time, there is no market for
    selling the property, and EBY has not come through with any compensation for it. So they continue
    trying to make do.

    1Mr. B is a fictitious name.




                                                                                                            108

358.     The Panel finds that OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement did not clearly
         anticipate the long delays and uncertainties in implementing the resettlement plan.
         There is clearly a requirement that the resettlement plan be time-bound, and the
         required components of a resettlement plan include a detailed implementation
         schedule and a means of monitoring that schedule to assure that it is kept.426
         These hardships and negative impacts caused by an unduly long transition period
         prior to the move could be considered to be part of the "losses" for which the
         affected population should be compensated. Without adequate planning for this
         eventuality, the large population left "in limbo" by this uncertainty exemplifies
         the situation referenced in OD 4.30: "Involuntary resettlement may cause severe
         long-term hardship, impoverishment, and environmental damage unless
         appropriate measures are carefully planned and carried out."427

359.     Again, OD 4.30 envisages a rapid movement of people, even in large-scale
         resettlement, but also emphasizes the importance of sustaining "existing patterns
         of group organization"428--the kind of patterns of group organization that have
         been interrupted and unnaturally deformed by the extended uncertainties of the
         Yacyretá Project's resettlement plan.

360.     The Panel finds that in the complex situation of this project, with its very
         long delays in implementation, the Bank should have made adequate
         allowances in the 1992 plan and later modifications of it for the severe
         hardships that have occurred as a result of uncertainties and delays in
         implementing the plan.       Where a person can document a loss directly
         attributable to the very long delay in resettlement, such loss should be
         recognized under OD 4.30, but the Panel recognizes that in practice this will
         be very difficult to implement.


   12. PROGRAMA DESBORDEDE ARROYOS (PDA) - THE URBAN CREEKS PROGRAM

361.     The Request raises a number of issues related to design and implementation of the
         PDA program. The Requesters believe that some families living in neighborhoods
         such as Pacu Cuá, Santa Rosa, M'boi Caé, Itá Paso, and San Blas are benefiting
         from the PDA program although they are not suffering the conditions of those
         living along the creeks, for which the program was indeed created. The Request
         cites the specific example of 110 families who live in the District of Cambyreta,
         on the banks of the Potí'y creek whose houses are inundated whenever it rains.
         The Request alleges also that there are "ravaged lands" in the Cambyreta district
         on the banks of the Potí'y creek that "are now unused because of the current
         elevation above sea level." The Requesters also claim that EBY did not
         adequately consult the affected people in preparing the PDA program.

362.      The Management Response explains that the PDA was developed in 1998 for
          "families between 78 and 84 masl that were living along urban creeks and were
          exposed to excessively high risks and thus could not wait until a plan to reach 84
          masl was agreed and implemented."429 According to the Response, in 1998 EBY
          defined high risks areas below 84 masl as "those neighborhoods along the main
          urban creeks" and "other areas not necessarily affected by natural urban creeks
          but exposed to similar high environmental risks located near open rain water and
          sewage channels."430 Management states that EBY carried out an assessment in
          1999 and identified "1,101 families in Encarnación below 84 masl, including
          families living along the Potí'y (308), M'boi Caé (589) and M'boi Tesa (204)
          Creeks."431

363.      Management maintains that the Bank "has been actively involved in the
          supervision of the PDA in order to ensure that it is implemented in compliance
          with OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement."432 In fact, although the Bank does
          not finance the PDA program, "its interest and commitment...results from the fact
          that it constitutes a subset of the resettlement contemplated by the Yacyretá
          Project's legal agreements."433 Management also "considers that the decisions
          adopted by EBY are consistent with applicable safeguard policies."434

364.      In response to the specific claims, Management states that, based on the Bank's
          advice, "EBY has modified its methodologies allowing for increased participation
          of families to be resettled by the PDA."435      Since 1999, EBY has conducted
          information meetings with local authorities as well as representatives from
          affected neighborhoods.436 In these meetings it has explained the program, its
          objectives, the criteria for inclusion, and the methodologies adopted. In addition,
          "[f]amilies have also been incorporated into the process of managing and
          planning some resettlement activities."437

365.      Management is aware that some families who were not included in the program
          may be dissatisfied with the exclusion. It notes that families living between levels
          78 and 84 masl at "relatively close distance" from urban creeks but not exposed to
          high risk will be resettled as part of any plan to raise the reservoir level to 83
          masl. Other families who live along urban creeks but above 83 masl who have
          demanded to be included in the PDA will not be because Management asserts
          there is no causal link between the reservoir and urban creek flooding.438

366.     With respect to the neighborhoods listed in the Request that, according to the
         Requesters, are not affected by the flooding, Management states that the Pacu
         Cúa, Santa Rosa, and M'boi Caé neighborhoods are indeed at high risk of
         flooding.    The Management Response also indicates that the PDA program
         included the construction of 674 houses for families already living in the
         resettlement site Itá Paso, although these families are not affected by flooding.
         They were included in the PDA program to improve their living conditions, as the
         GOP had provided Itá Paso with inadequate services and poor infrastructure.439
         Families resettled to Itá Paso belong to the so-called extra-censales group whose
         resettlement is financed by the government of Paraguay under the Third Owners'
         Agreement.440

367.     As to the special case of the 110 families from the Cambyreta district that the
         Requesters mention,441 according to Management, they are included in the PDA
         but "did not agree with the proposed resettlement site"442 and suggested a
         different site that would require EBY to purchase new land.443 However, the
         Response states that as the PDA was designed under "clear budget and land
         restrictions," the affected people's site proposal "was considered as an option to
         be analyzed as part of the resettlements planned in regard to the raising of the
         level of the reservoir to 83 masl."444       Management adds that the Bank "had
         recommended to EBY that the PDA provide a more flexible menu of resettlement
         options."445    However, EBY had pointed out that more flexibility in the
         implementation of the programs would lead to further delays that a range of site
         options was available (Itá Paso, Arroyo Porá or cash compensation instead of
         resettlement), and that "any future resettlement program will be designed with
         more flexibility."446

368.     The Panel met with representatives of the 110 families who refused to move to the
         resettlement site offered by EBY.447 Several people presented the Panel with
         other ideas for movement of their communities. They showed the Panel copies of
         letters they had sent proposing that they be allowed to purchase sites in a housing
         development closer to their existing properties, which would let them stay near
         their work places, church and community rather than move to the more distant
         resettlement site. The people interviewed had difficulties in understanding the
         reasons why such a distant resettlement site had been selected. They claim also
         that the purchase of the nearby sites they had proposed would be cheaper than the
         cost of EBY's proposed resettlement site.

                                                                                                   111

369.  These families did not accept a move to the resettlement site, even though they
      were suffering frequent flooding and poor living conditions in their present
      homes, because they hoped to negotiate their suggested alternative. According to
      the people, EBY's response on this matter was that they only had one resettlement
      site to offer. They did not deny the other option but pointed out that, since the
      water level has not risen yet, that option could be considered when and if the
      water rises.

370.  The Panel notes that both Management Response and EBY officials confirm that
      alternative sites for relocating these families were not considered in the context of
      the PDA program, even as future possibilities. As indicated previously, the Panel
      finds that the failure to consider acceptable resettlement alternatives violates OD
      4.30. The Panel further finds, as noted earlier, that the resettlement sites that were
      offered did not ensure access to employment and services comparable to the old
      neighborhoods.

371.  The Panel also interviewed many who appeared to be extremely confused about
      what the PDA program is about, why it was created, whether they were included
      in it, and when and if they were supposed to relocate.            Management itself
      acknowledges that some of the claims are "based on partial and incorrect
      information [and] misunderstanding about the scope of the PDA."448

372.  The Panel finds that, under OD 4.30, Management must ensure that affected
      people are systematically informed about the objectives of the PDA program
      and consulted with regards their options and rights during the preparation
      and implementation of the program. Many affected people were not.

                13. PROJECT SUPERVISION OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVE 13.05449

373.     In their submission to the Panel, the Requesters claim that the Bank has violated
         its policies on project supervision and project monitoring and evaluation. They
         allege that the Bank has failed in supervising the project, in particular the
         implementation of the resettlement activities. The Request emphasizes that, while
         the main civil works advanced during the last twenty years, the environmental and
         resettlement activities were left behind. In the Requesters' view, this meant that
         the Bank allowed the power plant to begin its operations before completing the
         resettlement of the affected population. This harmed thousands of people and
         forced them to live in an unhealthy environment.

374.     Management contends that it has exercised sound supervision as required by OD
         13.05 on Project Supervision.            It has had frequent contact with Government
         officials of both countries and with EBY personnel, made repeated field visits to
         the project site, and made sustained analysis of project issues.450 The Response
         adds that the Bank's supervision efforts have kept the Project moving in a positive
         direction. Management also states that it has periodically informed the Board
         about the evolution of the project and the challenges that it has faced during
         project implementation.

375.     Management adds that "Following the Board's endorsement of the Panel's
         recommendations of 1997, Management took several actions aimed at
         strengthening project supervision. Management reiterated its commitment to stay
         the course and protect the well-being of the affected people, consistent with the
         Panel's recommendations as endorsed by the Board, namely that `Bank
         assistance will be vital to sustainable outcomes.' The Bank, the Borrower and
         EBY have moved to address the concerns reflected in the Panel's Review.
         Nevertheless, while some aspects have gone well, others are subject to the
         frequent changes in EBY's management and political climate, and restricted by
         the chronic institutional weaknesses of EBY, and its insufficient commitment to
         consultation and participation."451

376.     Management asserts that the supervision efforts have included "...(a) close field
         supervision since 1999 by assigning the Task Manager to Buenos Aires and
         contracting a social expert based in Asunción, and (b) intensified supervision
         through the use of a more diversified supervision strategy. In addition to standard
         supervision missions, supervision visits to Posadas and Encarnación were
         conducted regularly by the Task Manager based in Buenos Aires and the social

         expert in Asunción."452 It adds that it developed a joint supervision instrument
         with IDB "to allow for senior Management to review problems and progress in
         project implementation, including resettlement and the PDA."453          Three High
         Level Supervision Meetings were held from 1999 to 2002, in which the Regional
         Vice President and other senior regional staff discussed project issues with high
         level government officials from Argentina and Paraguay and EBY. Management
         Response states that the Regional Vice Presidents made three visits to the project
         sites. The Panel notes that, although these high level supervision meetings reflect
         the serious concerns of senior regional management for the Project, these
         concerns were not apparent in the day-to-day supervision of the Project, as
         discussed below.

377.     Management Response contains also an Annex B, presenting information on the
         number of supervision missions conducted during the period 1999-2001, as well
         as a summary of Management's supervision of the Yacyretá Project in the period
         after the Inspection Panel's 1997 Report.      Management Response notes that
         "Management believes that the Requesters are not fully aware of previous and
         ongoing Bank supervision efforts as well as the specific positive results these
         efforts have generated."454

378.     OD 13.05 states that project supervision is one of the Bank's most important
         activities.455 According to OD 13.05, the main purpose of supervision is to "(a)
         ensure that the borrower implements the project with due diligence to achieve the
         agreed development objectives and in conformity with the loan agreement; (b) to
         identify problems promptly as they arise during implementation and help the
         borrower resolve them... (c)     to take timely action to cancel a project if its
         continuation is no longer justified, particularly if it can no longer be expected to
         achieve the desired development objectives."456 The OD adds that adequate
         resources must be allocated to supervision and the Regions should allocate
         resources "commensurate with the nature, complexity, and size of each project,
         with the problems experienced, and with the borrower's institutional capabilities
         and needs."457 These principles were not changed in OP/BP 13.05

13.1. Supervision of Environmental Operations

379.     In the Panel's view, a distinction must be made between the supervision of the
         environmental aspects of the main civil works components of the project and that
         of the resettlement activities. As shown in chapter 2 of this report, the Bank's
         participation in the design, execution and supervision of biophysical mitigation
         activities of the main works was quite successful. The frequent supervision

                                                                                         116

        missions were appropriately staffed, and a stable team of staff members have
        monitored the project's biophysical consequences. The relationship with EBY
        was strong and a number of corrective measures were taken to avoid or mitigate
        harm during project execution. These measures included, inter alia, improvement
        in coastal treatment activities to prevent contamination and negative impacts on
        health in Encarnación; the carrying out of a sedimentation study; the construction
        of baffle plates in the spillway to deal with gas over-saturation of water; a
        program to deal with the declining population of the Aylacostoma snail genus;
        aquatic weed control; and protected area (native reserve) control. The Panel
        therefore finds that the Bank met the requirements of OD 13.05 with regard
        to the environmental aspects of the main civil works components of the
        project.

13.2. Supervision of Resettlement Activities

380.    Aside from the overall claim about the failure of the Bank in overseeing the
        implementation of the project resettlement component, the Request primarily
        addresses problems related to the location and design of the resettlement sites, the
        quality of workmanship, and the lack of consultations with, and options provided
        to, those who must be resettled. The Management Response, by contrast, reviews
        supervision on a wide number of issues, including the shortcomings and late
        approval of Paraguay's Expropriation Law and the slow progress in constructing
        the new municipal market, a new slaughterhouse, a wastewater treatment plant,
        and in other activities.

381.    After reviewing the evidence presented by Requesters, Management's
        Response and the Panel's independent observations, the Panel finds that
        supervision of resettlement by the Bank is inadequate in two important
        respects: a failure to ensure sound technical quality in the design,
        construction, and implementation of resettlement programs, and inadequate
        consultation with affected people.

13.2.1. Technical Quality Assurance: Standards of Design, Construction and
Implementation

382.    The Panel found that supervision of the design, standards and construction
        of infrastructure for the resettlements associated with the Yacyretá Project
        has been inadequate.       Supervision missions appear to have given little
        attention to technical quality assurance.         This does not comply with
        Paragraph 29 of OD 13.05, as detailed below.

383.    The Panel's own observations during visits to resettlement sites in and around
        Encarnación    is   that problems     of  sewers   overflowing,    pump    stations
        malfunctioning, inadequate control of storm water, poor road construction, and
        poor house construction are easily seen. During its visits, the Panel saw clear
        evidence of a lack of supervision of construction activities.



                                                                                       117

384.    When addressing the Panel, technical staff of the Cambyreta municipality were
        highly critical of the design and construction standards being accepted by EBY
        and the Bank for the resettlement sites.458 Their criticism extended to design of
        the sewerage reticulation system, especially the gauge and diameter of pipes
        through which sewage would be pumped under pressure, the capacity of holding
        tanks, and the number and location of pumping stations. They were also critical
        of the design standards being used for road construction as well as the lack of
        provision for storm water drainage other than via the road surface itself. With
        respect to house construction, their criticism was that building standards were
        simply not being enforced: specific mention was made of roofing beams and
        trusses being under-sized, timber being inadequately cured, and damp courses
        being omitted above foundations and concrete slabs. For each of the above
        complaints, the Panel was taken and shown actual examples of defects and
        associated problems that were occurring in resettlement sites before they had even
        been occupied!

385.    The technical staff also expressed the view that Bank staff satisfied themselves as
        to the standards being applied by studying documents and failed to monitor
        whether these standards were actually applied during construction. In their view,
        in the absence of Bank oversight there is no incentive for EBY to adhere to good
        standards, as upon completion the civil works they are constructing are passed to
        other authorities, national or local, for operation and maintenance, and to the
        beneficiaries. The consequences and costs of poor design and construction thus
        shift away from EBY. The Panel was told that although the municipality had
        attempted to have EBY conform to their regulations, "EBY does as it wills,"
        claiming either that works are of a temporary nature and that deficiencies will be
        corrected before completion, or that the municipality has no jurisdiction until such
        time as the project is completed.

386.    When the question of design standards was raised with EBY staff, they indicated
        that EBY did not have specifications or standards of their own and therefore
        relied on consultants, contractors, and local authorities observing any applicable
        Paraguayan national standards. 459

387.    The Panel found ample evidence of poor quality construction within
        resettlement sites. Although the facilities look quite good at first sight, the Panel
        saw during its visits numerous examples of poor quality construction of houses as
        well as poor drainage systems, extremely poor road construction leading to easily
        lifted cobblestones and major pothole damage even on new roads, with severe
        problems caused apparently by the lack of, or defective, storm water drainage.

388.    In one case seen by the Panel, the quality of the design and construction on the
        site was so poor that it has effectively created a new class of affected people

         around the site, who may claim compensation. Due to extremely poor drainage at
         Arroyo Porá, the nearby areas, (well above the 84 masl level, lying just below the
         new resettlement site) suffered flooding from rainwater runoff from the
         resettlement site. The Panel observed a similar situation in December 2003 when
         it visited the early stage of construction of Arroyo Porá II site, which lies close by
         a neighborhood called Barrio Tacuary.460 The Panel finds that if supervision
         had been stronger, Bank staff would have spotted the poor quality of design
         and construction of resettlement sites.

389.     Bank staff are divided as to whether or not they carry responsibility for problems
         arising from poor or inappropriate design. One Bank staff member in a
         responsible position expressed the view that it is not the responsibility of Bank
         staff to check project designs and that it was certainly not their job to be
         "construction inspectors."    461  This contrasts sharply with the view of another
         Bank staff member, also in a responsible position, that it is the responsibility of
         Bank staff to ensure that detailed project designs and standards being applied are
         appropriate to the circumstances, and further, that it is their duty to make site
         visits to inspect the quality of work that has been undertaken with Bank
         funding.462

390.     A similar difference of opinion between Bank staff occurs with respect to the
         Bank's responsibility to ensure that standards being applied in civil works are
         appropriate. One view is that it is not the Bank's responsibility to check technical
         specifications or to ensure that national specifications accord with international
         best practice.463 The opposing view is that Bank staff do have the responsibility
         of checking technical standards being applied in Bank funded projects.464

391.     OD 13.05 on Project Supervision is specific that it is the responsibility of the
         Bank's technical departments to "exercise a quality assurance role in the
         supervision process" but qualifies this statement by adding "for which detailed
         procedures and responsibilities are defined by each Region."465 OD 13.05
         provides also for Bank staff to visit the project sites and facility.466

392.     The Panel finds that there is clear need for a greater level of supervision of
         technical design and construction in all facets of the Yacyretá resettlement
         scheme and notes the necessity for adequate supervision of technical design
         and supervision in resettlement schemes generally.

393.     After many visits to the area by the Inspection Panel and follow-up interviews
         with Bank staff members, the supervision mission of October 2003 noted in its

       Aide Memoire that "there is no integration of environmental management into the
       design and construction of urban civil works, mostly in the resettlement sites. This
       lack of integration is evident in the urban plan of many neighborhoods, such as
       Arroyo Porá where partial consideration was given to urban environmental
       parameters as the development of the whole taking into account level curves and
       natural drainage protection. In this last respect, the forced channeling works of
       the main creek, with deep and wide ditches that run in between and in front of
       houses, represent a high-risk situation for children and elderly people who must
       use small wooden bridges to reach the street." The Aide Memoire recommended
       that "immediate action should be taken to cover up these ditches in the most
       critical parts to prevent tragedies that would place the EBY in an increasingly
       fragile position before the community."

394.   This is in sharp contrast with Management's statements in its memorandum to the
       Panel on January 13, 2004 that "... Bank oversight has ensured that EBY's
       capacity to apply those criteria and procedures [appropriate environmental
       criteria and procedures] was sufficient... the Task Team verified the success of
       their approach through regular visits to the resettlement locations during
       supervision." The memorandum also noted that "[t]he approach used throughout
       this period has been consistent with Bank policy and practice toward projects and
       their sub-projects that have minimal environmental impacts (such as the Ita Paso
       and Arroyo Porá resettlement sites, as well as other minor PDA-associated
       infrastructure.)"467

395.   One of the specific issues mentioned in the Request, which relates directly to
       supervision of resettlement site construction, is the claim that resettlements built
       by the Project at Buena Vista and San Pedro have aggravated the environmental
       and health situation by directly discharging wastewater and refuse into the nearby
       creeks. Management Response notes that the solution to this problem is the
       construction of the wastewater treatment plant, to which the resettlement sites at
       Buena Vista and San Pedro will in due course be connected. The Panel finds
       that given the foreseeable delays in the construction and operation of the
       wastewater treatment plant, Management should have anticipated the
       problem of delay and ensured that appropriate interim arrangements for
       discharge of the waste were made until the plant was built and all house
       connections made.

396.   The Panel finds that Management's failure to ensure sound technical quality
       of work on the resettlement project and to encourage needed design changes
       as circumstances changed is not in compliance with OD 13.05 on Project
       Supervision. The fact that belatedly at the end of 2003 the Bank suggested some
       design changes with respect to a resettlement site does not yet bring the Bank into

        compliance, especially since Management suggested in its later memo to the
        Panel on January 13, 2004, that the site conditions were fine.468

13.2.2.Consultation with Affected People

397.    BP 13.05 makes explicit the principle that effective supervision necessarily
        includes consultation with project affected people. This is both to ensure that
        affected people have a voice as well as to ensure that problems affecting the
        project are uncovered. The Panel was struck by the large number of people at
        resettlement sites who insisted that no one from the Bank had ever come to visit,
        or discuss problems directly with the them, but rather had held meetings with
        EBY staff and some "leaders" of the affected people only in hotels or offices. The
        Panel is concerned that the Bank's supervision missions seem not to have
        interacted meaningfully with affected people or reviewed thoroughly the
        resettlement sites. A review of supervision mission reports indicates they do not
        generally include any minutes or records of on-site meetings with affected people.
        The Panel is further concerned that in any pre-arranged visit to a resettlement site
        with Project staff, the Bank may have seen the places where things were
        proceeding well and neither saw nor sought out the examples of where the project
        was not proceeding well. Effective consultation with affected people, in a setting
        in which they feel comfortable in providing information, may reveal project flaws
        and inadequacies in implementation.

398.    Some Bank staff interviewed by the Panel, however, insisted that they had visited
        resettlement sites, sometimes on their own and sometimes with EBY staff, and
        met directly with affected people, although they had not included records of such
        meetings within their supervision reports. Bank staff also mentioned several
        specific problems that they heard from affected people and brought to EBY for
        resolution, following up later to make sure that a resolution had been obtained.
        The Panel notes Management's statement that the High Level Meetings in 2000
        and 2001 included meetings with civil society groups and NGOs.

399.    The Panel finds that there is a wide discrepancy between the recollections of
        affected people in the project area, who insist there have been no meaningful
        consultations or thorough on-site visits, and Management's statements about
        supervision missions. The Panel finds that Management must ensure that it
        consults with and interacts meaningfully with affected people and that
        consultations must be in settings where affected people feel able to convey
        effectively their concerns to Management. Bank supervision missions should
        clearly state the places they visited during field inspections and the
        conditions under which they visited (e.g. with Project staff or accompanied
        by representatives of NGOs, etc.), in order to better document not only that
        supervision missions were present in the area, but that the supervision team
        members actually had contact with affected persons and looked into matters
        directly dealing with issues of safeguard policies.

13.3. Level of Supervision

400.     Under the conditions prevalent in the area and given the Project's protracted
         execution and its controversial nature, the Bank should have expected the
         need for a higher level of supervision and ensured that it was effective. The
         Panel observes that during field visits to the Project area many people affected by
         the project strongly expressed their own perception that corruption pervades the
         political life of the Project area and includes those responsible for, and benefiting
         from, resources provided by EBY. Some requesters and other persons met during
         field visits frequently expressed their suspicions of corruption in the awarding of
         contracts associated with the Project, in the sequencing in which affected people
         received compensation (including resettlement), and sometimes in the
         determination of which persons were compensated and the amounts of
         compensation received for resettlement.

401.     Aside from this widespread perception of corruption that was conveyed to the
         Panel, there is also considerable widely available published information about the
         history of the Yacyretá project that explores various accusations of corruption in
         the history of the Project itself as well as the political and institutional structures
         within which the Project operates.469

402.     The Panel is not in a position to comment on the accuracy of the perception
         of corruption. However, under these circumstances, the Panel finds that the
         Bank needs to expect a higher than usual level of supervision in order to
         ensure that corruption does not occur and to assure affected people that this
         is so.

403.     While a larger than average number of supervision missions, which included three
         High Level Supervision Meetings, demonstrates more intense supervision than is
         usual, it may not be an adequate response to alleviate the perceptions and
         suspicions of project-affected persons. Inadequate on site reconnaissance and
         supervision seems to be one of the biggest problems of this Project in terms of
         complying with Bank policies. This kind of finding has been a common thread in
         other Inspection Panel cases. This may have contributed to the affected people's
         apparent hostility towards the Bank staff. Many perceive that the only "Bank
         people" the affected people have met and talked with were the Panel and its staff,
         even though this may not be the case.

13.4. Expertise in Bank Supervision

404.     The Panel is concerned that while the Bank sent many supervision missions to the
         Project area, the teams did not identify or address the problems of technical
         quality in the resettlement sites identified earlier.                   The Aide Memoire of
         November 2003 acknowledged clearly for the first time the "need for better
         integration of environmental considerations in the design and construction of
         urban civil works, principally in resettlement neighborhoods." The Panel points
         to the need for Management to ensure that the supervision missions have the
         requisite technical expertise to review adequately the design and construction
         of urban resettlements and the impact of the resettlement areas on
         neighboring areas and to the need to ensure that reviews are conducted in an
         integrated way.470

405.       The Panel also notes that as the Yacyretá Project proceeded, the resettlement
         issues became progressively more important and difficult to address. The Panel
         notes that Management's supervision of the Yacyretá Project's resettlement
         and rehabilitation activities did not adapt effectively to this change by using
         more technical and social expertise to address problems of technical and
         social nature, as required to carry out by OD 13.05, paragraph 1 (b).

406.     The Panel analyzed Management Response to the Request for Inspection,
         including the attached matrix that lists the supervisions missions undertaken from
         April 1997 through October 2002.471 In addition, it reviewed the supervision
         reports related to most of those missions, i.e. Aide Memoires and Back to Office
         reports.472 The review focused on the composition of the supervision teams - in
         terms of number of people and their expertise - vis-à-vis the emerging project
         problems relating to resettlement.

407.     The records show that within the time frame June 1997- February 2003,
         supervision seems to have been particularly intense for a two-year period -
         between late 1999 and early 2002, when the then project's Task Manager, who
         was based in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and a social consultant based in Asunción,
         Paraguay, visited the project area very frequently. However, the Panel observes
         that from 1997 to 2003, while the problems in carrying out the resettlement
         activities continued to increase473 - the number of Bank staff concerned with the
         social issues who were supervising the project's implementation remained


470See § 12.2.1.
471Management Response, Annex B. In addition to the standard missions, the matrix reports 29 visits to
Encarnación and Posadas from late 1999 to early 2002 conducted by either then Task Manager based in
Buenos Aires, a social specialist/civil society liaison based in Asunción, or both.
472Not all the reports related to the frequent short visits conducted by the Task Manager and the Civil
Society Liaison between 1999 and 2002, referred to in footnote 471, were found in Bank files or were made
available for the Panel's review.
473There were many reasons for this, such as the constant influx of new people in the project area, the
growing number of complaints and requests of compensation directed to EBY, the delays in relocating
eligible affected people and the social issues related to the flooding of urban creeks.


                                                                                                       123

        substantially the same over time. With very few exceptions, only one person
        concerned with these issues was included in each visit (see figure IV-1). This
        contrasts sharply with the pattern for environmental experts, who were greater in
        number earlier in the project life cycle when environmental concerns were more
        dominant and who were fewer in number and visited less frequently as these
        issues became less critical.

408.    The Panel notes that the supervision missions appear to have been locked
        into formats established early in the project's life and to have not adapted to
        changing project needs. Thus, since project supervision initially focused on
        plants, animals and biodiversity issues, supervision appears to have continued to
        concentrate on them even though the project's central problems changed from
        biophysical concerns to problems of a social nature. Bank staff seemed to rely too
        much on documents rather than being in the area to try to solve timely problems
        and/or contingencies, and lacked frequent "reality checks" as part of the
        supervision activities. The emergence of the PDA474 ­ in itself a very positive
        development as a tool to deal with the dreadful conditions of people living above
        78 masl affected by frequent flooding ­ should have called for an increased
        supervision effort in the context of this controversial project but it did not. The
        Panel observes that developing a mechanism to allow both for continuity in
        supervision but also to adapt to changing situations would best help the Bank to
        comply with its policies on supervision.

409.    According to the Aide Memoire of October 2003, there has not been and there is
        not yet any clear strategy to counteract the negative perceptions that the
        population has of the project. This image is exacerbated by political manipulation
        of the Project. The absence of an effective communication strategy has
        significantly damaged relations between those concerned with implementing
        the project and the affected civilian population.

410.    The Panel draws attention to the recent supervision mission conducted in October
        2003. The Panel notes that the supervision mission's conclusions and
        recommendations regarding the social aspects of the project, as presented in

474See § 2.3.2.1.; 12.


                                                                                                                      124

      the related Aide Memoire of October 2003, reflect those that Bank policies
      require. The problem is that these detailed recommendations were given
      after twenty years of project implementation, rather than before approving
      the projects' resettlement plan and related documents. Indeed, they seemed
      to have come only after the Panel had completed most of its investigation and
      raised these issues with Management during the course of its investigation.

411.  The above mentioned supervision report acknowledges that the social impacts
      have never been identified and analyzed properly and that therefore no strategies
      have ever been designed to handle this type of situation. It adds that the issues
      related to urban, employment and other impacts were never tackled, while the
      urban impacts of resettlement were not defined and local authorities were not
      involved (until very recently) in the decisions on these matters. Although the
      resettlement and rehabilitation plans were requirements of the Bank's policies, the
      Aide Memoire recognizes that the baseline data were not established in due time
      and the censuses were not updated with the necessary frequency. Likewise, the
      fact that no enforceable cutoff dates were established encouraged the influx of
      population into the areas to be flooded.

412.  The report further states that the absence of baseline data produced diverse criteria
      for identifying the actual leaders of the affected community. Local governments
      did not assume their role in a timely fashion, and NGOs and non-representative
      associations took over representational functions within the affected community.
      According to the report, EBY and the World Bank had to "empower" these new
      leaders, with their own individual interests, who seem to have set up a complaint-
      based "business" in the area. Most of the complaints were based on impacts not
      related to the Project. Despite the bi-national character of the Project, no conflict
      resolution mechanisms were developed. Some mediation mechanisms have been
      implemented, but they have had a low degree of credibility and legitimacy with
      the population, and therefore a low probability of success.

13.5. Linkages Between Supervision Reports (Aide Memoires and Back-to-Office
Reports), Progress Reports to the Board, and Management Response to Request for
Inspection

413.  Given the serious delays in implementing the resettlement programs and the
      social and environmental problems associated with resettlement, the Panel
      inquired into whether the Aide Memoires and Back-to-Office reports reflected
      these conditions and whether the Progress reports to the Board reflected the
      content of the Aide Memoires and the Back-to-Office reports. The Panel is
      concerned that the some of the progress reports to the Board are more optimistic
      than the supervision reports in important respects.      It is also concerned that
      Management's Response to the Request is more sanguine than the supervision

414.     The Panel has reviewed Back-to-Office reports and the related Aide Memoires of
         the supervision missions conducted between June 1997 and February 2003. It has
         compared them with the statements included in Management's Response to the
         Request for Inspection and the Progress Reports on the Yacyretá project presented
         annually to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. The Panel notes that there
         are discrepancies among the different types of reports and that, in relation to
         specific issues, the progress reports to the Board have given a more optimistic
         account of the situation on the ground, than the Aide Memoires. Moreover, not
         until October 2003, after several visits by the Panel to the area, did an Aide
         Memoire accurately identify the many widespread and difficult problems in
         implementing the project and set forth in a realistic way the measures that need to
         be taken to comply with Bank safeguard polices.

415.     There are at least three ways in which some of the reports Management prepared
         for the Board presented a more optimistic outlook than the Aide Memoires and
         the circumstances merited: by continued reference to virtual completion of Plan
         A, even though it is still not fully complete; by setting forth dates for the
         completion of the resettlement that were too reassuring; and by describing the
         construction of the wastewater treatment plant "as soon to be started and
         completed", even though construction has yet to begin in 2004. The Panel also
         notes that the 2001 report475 contains a significant amount of material that is taken
         verbatim from the 2000 report, which raises a question of whether the report
         adequately reflected conditions a year later.476

416.     The Panel refers to several examples to illustrate the point above. Management
         Response, at Annex R, states that Plan A (actions pending from the raising of the
         reservoir to elevation 76 m) is "fully completed in both Argentina and Paraguay
         as of 1999." Management Response elsewhere indicates that "Plan A and Plan B
         are almost fully implemented, albeit with delays."477 The 1999 and the 2000
         Progress Reports to the Board repeat that "virtually all activities included under
         Plan A... were completed by December 1998."478 By contrast, the Aide Memoire
         dated April 16, 1999, reports that some actions related to the completion of Plan
         A are still outstanding, i.e. property titles still have to be conveyed to some of the
         relocated families, and sanitation works provided for the city of San Juan del

475 Management's Response includes Annex Q, Progress Reports to the Board, which in turn includes the
Progress Reports for 2001 and earlier. It appears, however, that the 2001 Progress Report was never
formally distributed to the Board.
476 Compare paragraphs 23-25 of the 2001 report with paragraphs 18 and 19 of the 2000; paragraph 32 of
the 2001 report with paragraph 25 of the 2000; paragraph 38 of the 2001 report with paragraph 29 of the
2000 report; and paragraph 30 of the 2001 report with paragraph 22 of the 2000 report. In the last case,
paragraph 30 appropriately notes, "As previously reported" to indicate that the substance of the report is
similar to that which was previously reported. The Panel notes that none of the material that is taken
verbatim from the earlier report appears in quotation marks, which makes it harder to identify the
repetition.

         Paraná have yet to be completed. The Aide Memoire dated April 2000 included
         similar conclusions.

417.     With regard to titling of plots, the progress report in year 2000 indicated that all
         titling would be done by December 2000, while the 2001 report noted that the
         titling is practically complete, though 142 cases were still not done.479 The Aide
         Memoire in October 2003 noted that dozens of these cases were still pending.480

418.     The 2000 and 2001 progress reports to the Board were too optimistic in
         anticipating the completion dates for resettlement plans under Plan A and Plan B,
         although the Panel recognizes that it is difficult to anticipate completion dates.481
         With regard to the resettlement program generally under the Project, the Aide
         Memoire of October 2003 lays out in detail the many things that still need to be
         done before the resettlement plans are complete.482

419.     The Project provides for the construction of a wastewater treatment plant.
         Management's progress report in 1999 indicated that the construction of the
         wastewater treatment plant would begin in January 2000 and be completed by
         mid-2001. The progress report for the year 2000 indicated that construction of the
         plant would begin in June 2000. As of January 2004, construction had not started
         on the plant.

420.     Based on the foregoing, the Panel finds that Management has in certain
         respects been too optimistic in informing the Board on the future of project
         implementation. The Panel understands that it is difficult to predict
         accurately when certain aspects of the project will be completed. It believes
         the reporting has understated serious difficulties in project implementation.
         The Panel especially notes that only after it had conducted its own field
         research from January through December 2003 and conducted follow up
         interviews, did Management produce an Aide Memoire (October 23-30,
         2003) that identified many of the problems the Panel had found and the
         remedial actions, which need to be taken.




479Ibid., ¶ 32.
480It appears from the Aide Memoire that 87 of these 142 cases are still pending.
481See Progress Report to the Board, January 20, 2000, ¶ 25; Progress Report to the Board, 2001, ¶ 32. The
2000 report indicated that the resettlement plan was 72.1% complete and would be fully completed by
April 2000, according to plan. The 2001 report indicated that resettlement plans for affected families in
Paraguay was 93% complete and would be fully completed by June 2002 according to plan. Both dates
were premature.
482Aide Memoire, October 23-30, 2003. The Aide Memoire notes, for example, that in Itá Paso, "no
actions have been implemented by EBY since August 2002," on the rehabilitation programs.

                              in Encarnación Urban Creeks
                                      Dr. Carlos Tucci

   1. Floods in the urban creeks of Encarnación and neighboring municipalities take
       place in the M'boi River and its tributaries as well as in some urban creeks, which
       flow directly to the reservoir. In general floods occur due to two main causes:
            · Downstream conditions: reduction of flow capacity downstream of a
                stream section will decrease the flow at the upstream section and thus
                increase its level so that water will overflow onto the flood plain. This
                could occur due to reduction of the flow capacity, section constriction, or
                an increase in the level of the water body into which the stream
                discharges. This could be sea-level, reservoir level, or the level of a major
                river into which the stream or creek flows.
            · Lack of local conveyance capacity: If the amount of water arriving at a
                river section is greater than the section's local flow capacity the water
                cannot be carried away so the water level increases. This causes water to
                flow across the flood plain. This type of flood impact is called local flood
                conditions in this annex.

   2. What must be determined is which of these is causing the flooding of the
       Encarnación urban creeks.

A.1    Analysis of river (downstream) conditions

1. Paraná River levels and M'boi Caé floods

   3. The Yacyretá reservoir will impact the Encarnación urban creeks only if the
       downstream conditions scenario, described above, occur.               The following
       evaluation examines the situation.

   4. The procedure to study the effect of the reservoir effect on Encarnación and
       Posadas is based a consideration of: (a) levels of the Paraná River at times that the
       M'boi Caé flooded before dam construction, and; (b) the level of the Paraná River
       when the M'boi Caé flooded after dam construction. According to the Lotti and
       Associates study483, "the floods in the areas of the influence of those creeks are
       not due to the current reservoir level, but rather are primarily due to rainfall in the
       catchments area of the creeks."

   5. However, this study was done for the proposed future reservoir level of 83 masl
       and not for the current operational level of 76 masl so this contention must be
       examined. Lotti (1999) present a simulation of Paraná River levels before dam
       construction (natural conditions) together with M'boi Caé flood recurrence

                                                                                         136

   intervals of 5, 10, 25 and 100 years. The selected discharge for the Paraná River
   was 38,000m3/s, with a river height of 78.8 masl at the mouth of M'boi Caé.
   These boundary conditions were for the situation before dam construction. The
   condition used by Lotti for after dam construction was with the Paraná River at
   83m. (This simulation was done in order to determine the limits of reservoir
   influence after it has been filled to 83 masl.)

6. The first of these Paraná River flow scenarios (i.e. 78.8m) has a recurrence time
   greater than 5 years (less than a 20% chance in any one year). This is not a
   frequent condition in the Paraná River. The probability of a five year flood in the
   M'boi-Caé occurring simultaneously with a five year event in the Paraná is less
   than 4%.




                                                                                 137

   7. Using the flow data for the Paraná River at Posadas for the period 1901-1994484, a
        flow duration curve was calculated. This curve is presented in figure A-2. This
        curve shows the period of time for which a flow is above a particular value. For

                           instance, this curve shows that 50% of the time the river flow is above
                           11,000m3/s (this would equate to a river level of above 74.7 masl).

   8. Using the rating curve for natural conditions in Posadas, and the frequency of
                           flow, the frequency of different river levels at Posadas was also calculated. This
                           is presented in figure A-3. It can be see that for natural conditions the level of the
                           Paraná River is mostly below 75.5 masl, and most frequently between 74.2 and
                           75.4 masl. These levels are those that occurred naturally in the Paraná River
                           before the dam was constructed.

2. Evaluation of combined conditions of Flood in Paraná River and Heavy Rainfall
in the M'boi Caé catchments.

                           9. In order to choose the boundary conditions for simulation of the water levels in
                               M'boi Caé, the question is:
                               · What are the levels of the Paraná River at Encarnación when there are heavy
                                  rainfall events in Encarnación?

                           10. In figure A-4. the relationship between the largest rainfall events at Encarnación
                               and Paraná River flows on the same day are shown. It can be seen that there is no
                               correlation between the events, they are independent of each other.

3. Analysis of the impact of the reservoir on floods in the M'boi Caé and other
creeks

                           11. Lotti (1999) surveyed river sections along the M'boi Caé and other creeks. These
                               sections have been used in this analysis to simulate the levels of this river. Figure
                               A-5. presents a schematic of the M'boi Caé River and its tributaries and the
                               sections used in the Lotti (1999) report. In this present study analyses were
                               undertaken for the following areas: the Poty river; the M'boi Caé; and for the
                               creeks which flow directly into the Paraná River.

   12. Poty River: In Figure A-6. the profile of the river bottom for the Poty is shown.
       It can be seen that the levels are all above 82 masl. It is thus clear that for a
       reservoir range of 76 to 78 masl the reservoir will have no influence on the floods
       in the Poty river. To support this it is noted that during the Panel visit to the site
       the flow velocity was estimated by floating material and determined to be near to
       uniform flow velocity. When a river is flowing close to uniform flow velocity the
       implication is that there is no downstream control on flow and no impact from the
       reservoir.

   13. The Panel nevertheless observed the flooded houses on the flood plain of Poity
       creek. There is no doubt that flooding does occur. The question arises, what
       causes the flooding if it is not due to the reservoir?

   14. Upstream of the Poty basin a resettlement area know as Buena Vista has been
       developed (see figure A-1.).         It is possible that this resettlement may have
       contributed to the flood peak downstream due to an increase in impervious areas
       leading to more rapid surface run-off.            However, the area of Buena Vista
       represents only about 4% of the Poty Basin so this is most unlikely to be the main
       cause of the flooding of the Poty river. It is much more likely that the cause of
       the floods in this area is the sum of all urbanization that has occurred upstream in
       recent years.      It has been established elsewhere that urbanization increases
       impervious surfaces such as streets, roofs, walk ways, etc. This in turn increases
       the mean annual peak flood by as much as six times over that which occurs in
       former rural conditions (Leopold, 1968). The likely cause of the increased Poty
       flooding is thus deemed to be increased urbanization of the creek's catchment and
       not the construction of the Yacyretá reservoir.

   15. M'boi-Caé: In the reach of sections S12 to SN03 a river level profile simulation
       was used to study the impact of the reservoir. The procedure was: Use of a
       conventional model used for a steady state level profile (Chow, 1959). This is the
       same type of the model described in Lotti (1999) which simulated the river profile
       for a steady state condition.

   16. Upstream conditions were taken to be peak flow for different recurrence intervals
       as presented in Lotti (1999); Using the four sections from Lotti (1999). The last
       section is about 2 km from the mouth of the M'boi-Caé into the Paraná River. In
       order to simulate the M'boi-Caé until near the Paraná River, a section close the
       mouth was constructed based on section S15 with its bottom displaced 1.90 m



                                                                                       142

       below that of the S15 bottom. This level was based on the slope of the river
       bottom profile. The section's characteristics were assumed equal to those of
       section S15 (the last surveyed section before reaching the Paraná River). This is a
       simplification, but it is a conservative procedure since the section near to the
       Paraná River would be larger than that used.

   17. The downstream boundary condition must be the level of the Paraná River. The
       most probable level of the river would be between 74.2 and 75.5 masl, but the
       lowest level in a river section would be for the uniform flow condition for a
       known flow volume. Using the upstream flood discharge, the uniform flow level
       was therefore calculated. These levels were determined to always be greater than
       the probable level (see Tables A-1 and A-2) so were used in the determinations.

   18. The simulations are presented in tables A-1 and A-2 and in figures A-7 and A-8.
       As can be seen there is no flood level increase due to reservoir operation until the
       Paraná River reaches 78 masl. When downstream river conditions reach 79 masl
       they start to have a small impact (<20 cm) on upstream levels. In May of 2003
       during the Panel's visit to Encarnación EBY presented an updated result from
       Harza (Harza y Consorciados, 2003) for the simulation at flow in M'boi-Caé.
       These results were from an updated survey which included more river sections.
       The results are similar to those obtained in this report.

   19. Conclusions: From these results it can be concluded that with the reservoir at 76
                   masl there will be no effect from the reservoir on the floods in the M'boi-Caé.
                   With the reservoir at 78 masl the effect will be minimal (1cm) and confined to
                   the section in the neighborhood of the juncture of the M'boi-Caé with the Paraná

      to the Yacyretá reservoir but due to the urbanization that has occurred upstream in
      the Poty River basin and the recent settlement which has occurred on of the
      creek's flood plain.

A.2   Reflections on local flood conditions

  20. Since the floods in the urban creeks have been shown not to be due to the level of
      the Paraná River and the effect of the Yacyretá reservoir the question remains,
      what could be the main causes of the floods along the urban creeks? The
      following observed elements of increased urbanization will be contributing to
      these local flood conditions:
          · Lack of storm sewers: Encarnación surface water flows through the streets
             and in open drains to the creeks and rivers. The lack of a storm water
             network to discharge storm water into the Parana River increases the flood
             impact in the creeks downstream of the city. The steep slopes leading
             from the main urban center to the creeks exacerbate the situation.
          · Rainfall intensity, duration and recurrence interval:       Rainfall intensity
             statistics for Encarnación are given in table A-3. The critical one hour
             duration values are also presented in table A-3. Table A-4 gives data on
             extreme rainfall events in Encarnación over the past half-century. This
             table shows that extreme rainfall events have increased since 1980. Figure
             A-9 shows that most of the flood events in Encarnación have also occurred
             after 1980. Thus there does appear to be a relationship between increased
             heavy rainfall and local flooding. But it must be remembered that the
             period since 1980 is also the period during which Encarnación has
             experienced population increase and increased urbanization;
          · Increase in impervious surfaces: With the increase in construction of
             houses, buildings, and paved streets, there is a consequential increase in
             impermeable areas. In general, one person is responsible for about 50 m2
             of impermeable area for population densities below 120 inhabitants per
             hectare (Tucci, 2001a). The increase in impermeable surfaces results in a
             large increase in the flood flow. Leopold (1968) showed that the mean
             annual flow can increase up to 7 times after the areas has been paved.
             Tucci (2001b) also showed an increase of 6 times in the mean annual
             flood of the Belém Basin in Curitiba, Brazil due to 60% of impervious
             areas in this basin of 42 km2; this effect of urbanization should thus not be
             underestimated. It is likely to be a most significant factor affecting the
             flooding of Encarnación's urban creeks.
          · Steep slopes: with steep slopes, such as those occurring in Encarnación,
             the flow velocity is high, creating potential danger to the population
             during high rainfall flood events. Encarnación has been developed from
             high to lower topographic levels. The rainfall from high levels flows
             downstream to lower areas, i.e. between 78 and 83 m. These low lying
             areas are now occupied by a poor people seeking a place to live. Flow
             velocities are high due to the steep slopes and impermeable surfaces. The



                                                                                      145

                                peak and volume of the floods in these areas is increased due to the
                                urbanization (impermeable areas). With the urbanization of the upper part
                                of the city the frequency of the floods events in the lower levels areas has
                                increased together with their impacts;

       · The effect of garbage: The large amount of garbage along the streets and
           curbs of Encarnación shows that the city's system of garbage collection is
           not appropriate. The volume of waste accumulating in the streets and
           inside storm water conduits, decreases their flow capacity and increases
           the flood frequency. In the downtown market there are some major drains.
           During the Panel inspection it was noted that portions of the drainage
           system were completed blocked by garbage or other dumped materials. In
           that reach, water was observed to be flowing out from the conduit on to
           the surface, flowing through the streets and under market stalls, before re-
           entering the conduit some distance downstream (see photograph). In
           Encarnación garbage obstruction to storm water flow is contributing to
           flooding in specific locations. This condition occurs mainly in the
           downstream reaches where the slope decreases and water velocity no
           longer has the capacity to transport the waste being carried in the water.
       · Obstruction of flow: There are works in the city such as bridges, land fills,
           road constrictions, among others, which were observed to decrease the
           cross-sections of many urban creeks in Encarnación. These conditions also
           contribute to flood frequency and depth upstream of these constrictions.

21. The above observations demonstrate that the floods in the Encarnación urban
    creeks will have been affected by the urbanization that occurred after 1980,
    possibly increased extreme rainfall events, and garbage reducing stream flow.
    Taken together these factors have increased the flood frequency in Encarnación's
    urban creeks.



                                                                                    147

1. The Encarnación Urban Creeks which flow directly to the Paraná River

   22. The urban creeks that flow through Encarnación directly into the Paraná River all
       have steep gradients. Due to the slope the Yacyretá reservoir level cannot increase
       the flood levels in these streams. In these locations the increased flooding is due
       to a combination of the factors discussed above:
           · Lack of urban drainage and storm-water sewers;
           · Excess garbage accumulation in stream sections;
           · Upstream urbanization

2. Observations on urban drainage in the resettlement areas

   23. During the Panel inspections the resettlement area of Arroyo Porá was visited.
       Several problems related to urban drainage were observed: This area has been
       developed without a network of storm sewers; Since the slope of this area is very
       steep the street pavements, made by stone blocks, had already been damaged by
       storm water flowing down the street; Downstream of the resettlement area, down
       a steep slope, the channel which receives the water from the streets was poor
       designed. The consequence was that the channel had overflowed and flooded
       houses and fields below the new and as yet only partially occupied resettlement
       site.

   24. The urban drainage planned for the new development has clearly not taken into
       account the flood increase that will occur in the downstream creeks as a
       consequence of the resettlement site urbanizing a previously rural and vegetated
       location. The net effect is to transfer the problem of excess storm water from the
       resettlement area to those living downstream from the new development.

   25. These problems should have been identified if there had been an Environment
       Assessment Report on the resettlement site. OD4.01 Paragraph 8 indicates that
       for some small investments (such as housing developments) a full EA is not
       required (paragraph 8 item c) but this case         "environmental sitting criteria,
       construction standards, and inspection procedures for housing projects" must be
       observed. The OD does not mention which criteria should be followed. Paraguay
       legislation for this type of construction does not require the provision of an urban
       drainage network, or control of downstream peak flow, as many cities in
       developed countries do.       However, in the view of the Panel the lack of
       Paraguayan standards for urban drainage control does not justify the development
       of housing which creates impacts on neighbours cannot be accommodated in the
       World bank Safeguard Policies.

   26. During the Panel's visit to Encarnación in May 2003 it visited the same places as
       illustrated in the photographs and observed the following: The damaged stone
       blocks of some streets had been repaired; In flooded houses downstream of the
       resettlement site there had been minor changes to the street drainage (part of the



                                                                                       148

surface street flow was being diverted onto land adjacent to the streets. In the
Panel's view these are palliatives to the problem and do not resolve the bad
channel design. It must therefore be anticipated that the houses down slope from
the resettlement site will continue to be flooded after future intense rainfall. No
effort had been made to damp the urban drainage hydrograph for the resettlement
site in order to minimize, if not prevent, flooding of areas downstream from the
newly urbanized resettlement location.
