                    PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT

                BRAZIL ALTO TURI LAND SETTLEMENT PROJECT
                              (LOAN 853-BR)


                                 PREFACE


          This is a performance audit of the Alto Turi Land Settlement Project
in Brazil, for which Loan 853-BR in the amount of US$6.7 million was approved
in July 1972.   The loan closing date was extended from December 1, 1978 to
December 31, 1980, and with a final disbursement on January 20, 1981, this
loan became fully disbursed.

          The audit report consists of an audit memorandum prepared by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) and a Project Completion Report (PCR)
dated July 30, 1981.    The PCR was prepared by the Latin America and the
Caribbean Regional Office on the basis of a country visit in March 1981. The
audit report is based on a review of the Appraisal Report (PA-132a) dated
June 20, 1972, the President's Report (P-1112) dated June 23, 1972, the Loan
and Project Agreements dated July 24, 1972, and the PCR.    The case study in
the Operational Policy Review, The Supervision of Bank Projects (OED Report
No. 2858, dated February 22, 1980) was also reviewed.     Correspondence with
the Borrower and internal Bank memoranda on project issues as contained in
relevant Bank files have also been consulted, and Bank staff associated with
the project have been interviewed.

          An OED mission visited Brazil in July 1982.     The mission held
discussions with officials of the State and Federal Governments and the
executing agency.   A visit to the project area was undertaken and settlers
were interviewed.   The information obtained during the mission was used to
test the validity of the conclusion of the PCR.

          The draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments on Octo-
ber 13, 1982.   Comments from the Borrower have been attached to the audit
memorandum.

          The audit finds the PCR accurate with respect to describing and
analyzing the project's implementation and impact.  The points discussed in
the audit memorandum have been selected because of their importance to this
and other Bank-supported projects.

          The valuable assistance provided   during the preparation of this
report by Government and executing agency    officials, as well as settlers
visited, is gratefully acknowledged.

                 BRAZIL ALTO TURI LAND SETTLEMENT PROJECT
                               (LOAN 853-BR)


                                HIGHLIGHTS


          In response to severe cyclical droughts in Brazil's Northeast,
migration occurred towards Amazon areas, mainly spontaneously, along new roads
that were opened up.   Government was looking for viable, low-cost, long-term
solutions to resettlement assistance.     The Alto Turi project was a pilot
effort in that direction.     As appraised, the project would provide stable
employment and satisfactory incomes for an estimated 5,200 settler families
and introduce a number of new concepts and procedures. A special agency was
established to execute the project, Companhia de Colonizacao do Nordeste
(COLONE). The project was to provide for: surveying and demarcation of 5,200
holdings; construction and/or improvement of 385 km of roads; construction of
62 schools, a hospital and ten dispensaries; expansion of logging and milling
operations; research; cattle holding; and studies.    The Bank loan of US$6.7
million - approved in July 1972 after a rapid processing period - was to
finance 53% of project costs.

          The project was to be implemented over five years, but protracted
start-up problems led to a three-year delay in project completion and was a
major factor in the escalation of total project costs from around US$12.6
million to US$34.4 million.     Revised project goals regarding basic infra-
structure were basically met.      However, although surveyed and demarcated,
only few titles have so far been issued to settlers.   Some 6,100 settlers now
live in the project area; some 2,600 have benefitted from all aspects of the
project while another 1,200 benefitted from most project activities except
credit.   Farmers' net cash incomes are well above appraisal estimates.
Substantially increased project costs have been offset by higher and higher
value production and substantial increases in real prices for beef.

          The project has only been partly successful.    On the positive side,
a substantial number of settlers benefitted from the project, and the rate of
return (13%), although lower than estimated at appraisal (16%), is still
satisfactory.   In contrast, as a pilot approach to low-cost settlement the
project failed.    Some other project objectives (such as environmental pro-
tection, community organization and self-help, participation of existing
institutions, strengthening of the credit and marketing cooperative movement)
have only been partially achieved; also, research in the project area leaves
much to be desired. A follow-on project (Maranhao Rural Development Project -
Loan 2177-BR) aims to rectify some of these shortcomings.

          The major lesson from this project experience is that a project
cannot be prepared and appraised in "isolation".     In particular, this ex-
perience demonstrates the need for:    (a) a careful review of the institu-
tional and legal environment in which the project is to operate; (b) a phased
approach to preparation and appraisal; (c) sufficient time to review prepara-
tion and appraisal documents; (d) a determination of the role of expatriate
consultants in the preparation process; and (e) consensus about project
concept (PPAM, paras. 11-24).    Another important, although one could argue
costly, project experience is that through this project the Bank has gained a
far better understanding of the intricacies of land tenure and title issues.
This has resulted in the inclusion of substantial numbers of land regulariza-
tion components in recent rural development projects in Northeast Brazil
(PPAM, paras. 25-31).

         Other points of interest are:

    -    the Bank was lenient in accepting the continuous non-adherence
         to counterpart funding covenants (PPAM, para. 19 and PCR, para.
         12.04);

    -    excellent cooperation between the highways and agricultural divi-
         sions ensured sufficient and competent supervision of the feeder
         roads component (PPAM, para. 37);

    -    good staff continuity during project supervision, but insufficient
         additional expertise, was added to supervision missions (PPAM,
         paras. 36-40 and Annex 1, and PCR, paras. 11.03-11.06);

    -    the failure of the environmental components is, to a large extent,
         due to the failure to translate project objectives into project
         components (PPAM, paras. 45-48);

    -    farm and approach roads must be aligned according to topography
         and not on an arbitrary geometric pattern (PPAM, paras. 51-55,
         and PCR, para. 12.08); and

    -    the bi-monthly reports to the Executive Directors on Bank/IDA
         operations provide inadequate information on portfolio performance.
         A review of the present reporting practice might be useful (PPAM,
         para. 43).

                  BRAZIL ALTO TURI LAND SETTLEMENT PROJECT
                               (LOAN 853-BR)


                                I.    SUMMARY


A.   Background and Project Formulation

1.        During the period 1964-70, mainly in response to severe cyclical
droughts in Northeast Brazil, there was growing Government interest in
assisting emigration to regions of higher rainfall in the pre-Amazon and
Amazon areas.    Settlement began spontaneously as new roads were opened up;
they often resulted in the degradation of tropical forest areas. The shifting
cultivation practiced by the immigrants did not appreciably enhance their
income or standard of living.   The Government of Brazil, faced by heavy costs
and an uneven record of its earlier Amazon settlement efforts, was seeking
viable long-term solutions to resettlement problems. The Alto Turi project in
the pre-Amazon area of the Northeast State of Maranhao would build upon
limited previous settlement efforts in the areal/.     It was intended to be a
pilot scheme to test the feasibility of a low-cost approach to settlement,
relying on considerable inputs of voluntary labor from the settlers for
community works.

2.        An FAO-CP/Bank identification mission visited Northeast Brazil in
November 1968 and identified, among others, the Maranhao Settlement Project.
FAO-CP subsequently prepared terms of reference for the feasibility study and
determined what additional studies had to be prepared by Brazilian authori-
ties.   Project preparation was subsequently done by consultants, who were
financed by the British Overseas Development Ministry (ODM).   A final feasi-
bility study was submitted in late 1971.2/   Following appraisal in November/
December 1971, the project was presented to the Board on July 6, 1972 (a
relatively rapid processing period).

3.        As appraised, the project would provide stable employment and
satisfactory incomes for an estimated 5,200 settler families and introduce a
number of new concepts and procedures.  To reach this objective "the project
would be carried out over a five-year period (1973-78) and would include:


1/   The Northeast Development Superintendency (SUDENE) had, since about
     1963, sponsored settlement in the project area, especially south of the
     Turiaucu River.   SUDENE had registered and settled about 850 families
     (out of 2,900 families who spontaneously moved into the area).       By
     1971, some 18 settlement nuclei and an 80 km narrow feeder road network
     had been established.

          formation of the Companhia de Colonizacao do Nordeste (COLONE) as
          an autonomous authority responsible for colonization in the project
          area, including land surveys, on-farm development, road and building
          construction, research and extension, cattle supply, surveys and
          studies;

          design and construction of about 22 km of penetration roads, 234
          km of access roads, and 49 km of trails, as well as the improvement
          of about 80 km of access roads;

          land surveys and demarcation              of   about   5,200   individual     holdings
          of about 40 ha each;

          establishment and        operation   of    a   research station and         of cattle
          holding grounds;

          expansion of logging and milling operations;

          construction   of   62    schools,   a hospital and ten dispensaries;              and

          studies on rice, beef and timber marketing, preparation of a
          second phase of land settlement, and a survey of the project
          area's water resources."l/

B.   Project Implementation and Impact

4.       The Bank loan of US$6.7 million was approved by the Board on July 6,
1972 and the Loan Agreement was signed on July 24, 1972. There was consider-
able delay in making the loan effective:  the date was postponed three times.
The loan was declared effective on February 15, 1973, but the obtaining by
COLONE of full and undisputed title to project land remained a problem
throughout the project period.

5.       The project was to be implemented over five years, but protracted
start-up problems led to a three-year delay in project completion and were a
major factor in the escalation of total project costs from around US$12.6
million to US$34.4 million in current prices.2/      Among the major factors
(some closely interrelated) contributing to implementation delays and higher
costs were:   inadequate consensus among Government agencies, and between the
Government and the Bank, on project design and on the viability of the low-
cost settlement model proposed; the need to revise, early in the implemen-
tation phase, recommendations on farming systems; irregular and inadequate

     dated June 20, 1972, para. 4.02.

2/   The Bank loan, therefore, financed only               20%   of   project   costs   instead
     of 53%, as envisaged at appraisal.

provision for counterpart financing; delays and shortages of farm investment
(medium-term) credit; and legal difficulties related to land title transfer
from Maranhao State to COLONE. Project execution took place, in fact, between
1976-80.

6.        The road network, originally expected to be 305 km, was reduced to
238 km, at unit costs substantially above appraisal estimates.   Other project
goals with regard to basic infrastructure (schools, health posts, hospital and
staff housing) were essentially achieved.      Land surveys and demarcation
were undertaken, but only a few titles have so far been issued to settlers.
A cattle quarantine, an experimental farm with improved pastures, and a
research station have been established.    However, overall research achieve-
ments have been limited and research in the project area still leaves much to
be desired. Saw milling operations were expanded, and a brick factory and
black pepper and rice mills were established.      Only some of the envisaged
studies were undertaken.

7.        Some 6,000 settler families (800 above the appraisal estimate) now
live in the project area.      Of these, some 2,600 have benefitted from all
aspects of the project and are following one of the recommended farm develop-
ment plans. Another 1,200 registered farmers have received benefits from most
project activities except credit; some 2,200 unregistered farmers can be
assumed to have partially benefitted from the social and physical infrastruc-
ture.   In addition, there are some 4,400 registered settlers in the expansion
area who have not yet benefitted from the project (except for occasional
community development assistance from COLONE).    Production support services,
health, education and community development activities are operating.     How-
ever, the transfer of responsibility for operation and maintenance of these
services to the State agencies has been seriously impeded because these
agencies had little to do with project design and execution, and by recurrent
cost funding constraints in the State budget.    Farmers net cash incomes are
now estimated to be well above appraisal estimates.      The substantially in-
creased project costs have been largely offset by higher than expected crop
production due to the larger area under cultivation, including food crops, the
introduction of black pepper as a major cash crop, 1/ and substantial real
price increases for beef.

8.        The project has been only partly successful.       On the positive
side, a substantial number of settlers benefited fully or partially from the
project. The rate of return (13%), although lower than estimated at appraisal
(16%), is still satisfactory.     The project has demonstrated that settlers
can develop farms so that they will earn a reasonable living for themselves
and their families.   However, most of the project's wider objectives have not
been achieved.  It was mainly seen as a pilot approach to low-cost settlement,
to serve as an important guide to future colonization policy.    But, firstly,


1/   Black pepper (Piper nigrum) was considered during preparation for inclu-
     sion in the basic cropping pattern but rejected as it was determined
     not suitable for wide replication in the Amazon.
                                   - 4 -


the approach has turned out not a low-cost one; and secondly, therefore, the
project has not been replicable for future colonization.    Other aspects in
which objectives have only been partly achieved are:

     (a)   less than the planned area of forest reserves were established and
           environmental protection was not achieved;

     (b)   community organization and self-help has not      been   successfully
           established in areas of controlled settlement;

     (c)   existing institutions did not fully participate in project implemen-
           tation; therefore, they did not effectively take over maintenance
           and operation of project services and facilities;

     (d)   research in the project area leaves much to be desired; and

     (e)   strengthening the credit and marketing cooperative movement in the
           project area has not been successfully accomplished.

Some, but not all, shortcomings have been rectified under the follow-on
project (Maranhao Rural Development Project - Loan 2177-BR).I/ Through this
project, however, the Bank has gained a far better understanding of the
intricacies of land tenure and title issues, which was the most important
project experience.    This has resulted in substantial land regularization
components being included in recent rural development projects in Northeast
Brazil.

C.   Project Administration and Organization

9.         The executing agency for the project, Companhia de Colonizacao
do Nordeste (COLONE) was created specifically for implementing this project.
An autonomous authority was favored at appraisal to facilitate timely
decision-making by resident officials and to give terms of service to staff
that would attract suitably qualified personnel.      However, because of its
autonomous status, COLONE initially found itself isolated, without much
political and institutional support, and with inadequate funding.         This
situation has only improved in the last few years of the project.        While
COLONE has shown its ability to implement land development and settlement to a
commendable degree, it has never been on a secure financial footing, and from
that point of view, it is difficult to regard it as a well-established insti-
tution.   Without its significant role in the follow-on project, COLONE would
probably not have survived.

10.      From the beginning, COLONE had a dual function.  First, in relation
to the project under review, its role was one of implementation:      it was
expected to divest itself of all key components, once they were successfully

established, to relevant State authorities.     Only limited success has been
achieved in this area.    The transitional role of COLONE has been confirmed
under the follow-on project.l/     Second, although created for the project,
COLONE was viewed as implementing future colonization projects in the North-
east. However, except for the follow-on project, no other colonization
projects have yet been clearly identified.   Given the role of the Federal and
State Land Institutes in settlement, it is unlikely that COLONE will implement
any other colonization projects beyond its participation in the follow-on
project.


                                  II.   MAIN ISSUES


A.   Project Start-up and Preparation

11.       The Northeast of Brazil contains possibly the largest concentration
of poverty in Latin America.      While there has been a long history of deep
concern about regional income disparities and about the extent and degree of
poverty in the North East, hardly any external funding went to that region in
the 1940s and 1950s.    In the 19 60s, USAID and IDB undertook to finance proj-
ects in that region.   The Bank's lending program in Brazil, at that time, was
mainly concerned with supporting the Government's program for economic reform,
reducing the large public sector deficit, and reducing Brazil's dependency on
coffee exports; the main criterion for project selection was ready avail-
ability.2/    However, in the late 1960s, institutional pressure grew to
direct more Bank funding to the Northeast. The visit of the Bank's President
to Brazil in October 1968, including the Northeast, was followed by a major
FAO-CP/Bank identification mission in November/December 1968 which identified
a settlement project.

12.       A follow-up FAO-CP mission in February/March 1969 also discussed,
inter alia, the settlement project. It reported as follows:

     "SUDENE provisionally suggested that the project proposed by the mission
     includes a 5,000 family scheme and requested Programme assistance to
     prepare specifications for the resources survey.....     On the basis of
     these surveys, which would be carried out by Brazilian agencies, an
     international consulting firm would prepare the project.   The attache at
     the British Embassy in Rio expressed a provisional interest in assisting
     the preparation of the project." 3 /


1/   "Assurances have been received that COLONE would furnish to the Bank,
     not later than July 31, 1983, a program satisfactory to the Bank for
     the transfer of project-related responsibilities, facilities and staff
     to the State or other appropriate entities and complete the program by
     June 30, 1987."    (Maranhao Staff Appraisal Report, op. cit., para.
     5.10).

13.     In the meantime, settlement was already taking place in the area
selected for the project, both spontaneously and organized in a SUDENE scheme
south of Alto Turi.    A joint ODM/FAO-CP mission in July/August 1969 made
detailed recommendations regarding the preparation work and surveys to be
undertaken by Brazilian agencies, mainly to map land use capability, recon-
naissance soil surveys, forest inventories and a survey of water resources.

14.       Consultants were contracted by ODM and fieldwork was started in
August/September 1970.   An ODM land resources expert, reviewing soil data in
the field, concluded that the project area contained soils not suitable for
intensive cultivation. When an FAO-CP/Bank mission visited Brazil in December
1970, it was agreed that a more simplified project based on rice and beef (one
or two years cropping followed by pasture) should be developed.       The same
mission also noted that "little was known about the project in Rio de Janeiro,
and the SUDENE staff in Recife seemed to be rather detached from the prepara-
tion activities" and also recommended that "ODM should be encouraged to send
the project coordinator and the project manager to Colombia for about one week
to study related problems in the Caqueta Colonization Project"J./

15.       The consultants    completed fieldwork in July 1971.     Their interim
report was reviewed by the   consultants, FAO-CP staff, and Government officials
in Brazil in October 1971.    Three issues were raised: the need for new aerial
photography, the formation   of an autonomous development company to operate the
project, and the mechanism   for issuing land titles.

16.       Appraisal took place in November/December 1971.   The Board approved
the loan on July 6, 1972.      Substantial delays followed:    the project was
only implemented between 1976-80 instead of the planned 1973-75 (PCR paras.
4.01-4.04 and PPAM para. 5).    Major reasons for this delay were insufficient
consultation with various special Government agencies, such as the National
Colonization and Land Reform Institute and the Central Bank, and the creation
of an autonomous agency (COLONE) which found itself isolated from state,
regional and federal agencies.     This resulted in insufficient and erratic
funding and lack of investment credit.       Thus, the project demonstrates a
classic case of preparation and appraisal in "isolation"; this project experi-
ence also shows that such "isolated" preparation does not work. The following
lessons can be learned from the foregoing:

     the need for:

     (a)   a careful review of the institutional and legal environment in which
           the project is to operate;

     (b)   a phased approach to preparation and appraisal;



1/   FAO/CP mission back-to-office report. Caqueta Land Colonization Project,
     dated December 29, 1970 (see para. 23).
     (c)   sufficient   time   to   review   preparation   and   appraisal   documents;

     (d)   determining the role of expatriate consultants          in the preparation
           process; and

     (e)   consensus about the project concept.

17.       On the other hand, there were intense pressures for speedy prepara-
tion.  First, substantial colonization was occurring in Brazil in general and
the resulting shifting cultivation was beginning to destroy one of Brazil's
great natural resources, the tropical forest.   Second, there was substantial
institutional pressure within the Bank to produce development projects for
Northeast Brazil.    Third, there was serious concern about the speed of
spontaneous settlement in the project area and thus the feeling that a project
was needed sooner rather than later.

18.       INCRA, the National Colonization and Land Reform Institute, had -
and still has - overall national responsibility for settlement.   In addition,
there was an institute in the State of Maranhao which was also involved in
settlement issues.    There is no indication that these institutes had been
involved in preparation and appraisal to any extent.    Neither these, nor the
Central Bank, are mentioned in the appraisal report among the institutions that
would be concerned with the project, yet, as it later turned out, both the
Central Bank and INCRA had approval authority over project proposals.l/

19.       COLONE had no source of revenue and was dependent on budget alloca-
tions.   There is no indication that during preparation or appraisal the
funding of the potential executing agency was investigated in any detail
except for obtaining the usual assurances:  "Government would make available:
(a) quarterly in advance to COLONE funds to cover all project expenses,
including those to be reimbursed by the Bank; and 2b) promptly as needed to
BNB funds for medium-term onlending to settlers".2,    Nevertheless, counter-
part funding has been a major problem throughout the life of the project.
Substantial efforts were made by Bank staff to resolve continuous financial
crises, but to little avail.  This may have been partly due to the failure of
the Bank to understand fully the institutional framework in which COLONE had
to operate. The Bank was lenient in accepting the continuous nonr-adherence to
these covenants.

20.       From the beginning, the issuing of land titles was regarded as
critical for the project; however, only limited effort was made by the Bank to


1/   It should be pointed out that there was also apparently, insufficient
     coordination within Brazil, as is demonstrated by the fact that a loan
     was approved for a project which was later strongly opposed by the
     Central Bank and had not yet been approved by INCRA.

investi ate the complexities of the land tenure and titling laws and regula-
tions.T/ Thus, in retrospect, insufficient review of the institutional and
legal environment was a serious omission.2/       Such reviews should be an
integral part of any preparation and appraisal effort.

21.       Because of time constraints imposed by a tight timetable, various
preparation phases were carried out simultaneously rather than in their
logical sequence.    Thus, for example, the reconnaissance soil survey was
only completed during the feasibility study phase, necessitating substantial
changes during the study.   This experience underscores the need to undertake
preparation in carefully designed phases with decision points in between. The
use, from the beginning, of very detailed preparation timetables, realisti-
cally assessing time intervals needed, will facilitate understanding of the
critical preparation path.

22.        Time is needed to review preparation findings at various intervals
and at all relevant levels.    A critical decision point occurred upon comple-
tion of the reconnaissance soil survey when it became obvious that the only
possible cropping system was an extensive one, with provisions for a fallow or
pasture period (para. 14).    Subsequent prolonged discussions about the need
to make some changes in the technical package (PCR para. 4.03) show that
insufficient consultation had taken place at that point in the preparation.
The preparation report was only discussed with senior officials in the
Ministry of Interior and SUDENE. While there was satisfaction with the draft
report as far as these officials were concerned, later events make it clear
that other interested Government agencies had not been consulted (PCR para.
3.02).   The time allocated for an internal review process of the preparation
report at all relevant working levels within the Brazilian bureaucracy might
also have been too short.   There was definitely insufficient time for Govern-
ment to review the appraisal report; Government was invited by telex dated May
22, 1972 for negotiations that began on May 26, 1972.     There are no indica-
tions that draft appraisal reports had been sent to Government in advance of
negotiations, despite the recommendations to do so by the appraisalJmission.3/



1/   Only in May 1978 did a Bank lawyer visit Brazil to obtain a better
     understanding of the legal issues involved in land titling under the
     project.

2/   See also PPAR - Ecuador Milagro Irrigation, Credit 425-EC, audit report
     under preparation.

3/   "The Minister of Planning indicated that the Government would appreciate
     a preview of the appraisal report well in advance of negotiations; the
     mission strongly supports this request as this project may have consi-
     derable bearing on future colonization projects in Brazil and would
     involve a number of complex policy decisions by Government."   Appraisal
     mission back-to-office report dated December 14, 1971.
23.       The role of consultants also needs to be carefully reviewed.   There
is some doubt as to whether international consultants were needed to undertake
the feasibility study; it might have been preferable to use FAO-CP, who had
prepared the Caqueta Land Colonization Project in Colombia.!/       Consultant
selection was partly based on the assumption that sustained agriculture
(possibly with treecrops) was possible in the project area and the consul-
tant's  experience with preparation of Bank-financed treecrop settlement
projects in East Asia was deemed to be relevant; partly also on the
availability of bilateral preparation funds.    Consultants can play a useful
role in preparation, especially in undertaking technical investigations or in
pulling together available data and project concepts in a concise feasibility
study.   But in this case, the consultants were employed too soon; they should
only have started after the reconnaissance soil survey had been completed.

24.       The audit findings support the PCR (para. 3.02) that "a full and
real consensus on project objectives and design was probably never reached
(either within the Government or between the Government and the Bank)".    Lack
of such complete consensus explains to a large extent the difficulties encoun-
tered during project implementation.   It related to the basics of the project:
the pattern of settlement to be followed (support of spontaneous settlement,
directed settlement or organized settlement) and the technical package or farm
model to be promoted.     Full and real consensus is clearly essential for
project implementation.

B.   Land Titles

25.        A condition of effectiveness of the loan was that "Maranhao shall
have transferred to COLONE the title  to all land comprising the project area,
free of encumbrances,   costs or any other charges".2/     In fact, title  was
transferred to COLONE, but not free of encumbrances, as was later discovered.

26.       What had happened was the following.     Originally the State of
Maranhao had set aside a large part of its Northwestern territory for coloni-
zation.   Subsequently the State legislative assembly authorized the State
Government to transfer lands belonging to the State to COLONE.3/      The law
defined the land to be transferred, and some of the land within that area,


1/   This project, supported by the Bank somewhat ahead of the Alto Turi
     project, was designed to support spontaneous colonization taking place in
     the upper reaches of the Colombian Amazon.      In fact, there are many
     similarities between these two projects.     See also:   PPAR - Colombia

which already belonged to private individuals or had been reserved for Indians
or other purposes by federal legislation, was excluded.        For purposes of
fulfilling this condition of effectiveness, the Bank was furnished with a copy
of the law, a copy of the proceedings of the meeting of COLONE shareholders
in which the State's contribution to the capital of COLONE in the form of
939,000 hectares was approved, and copies of certificates from the real
estate registries in the project area, stating that 939,000 hectares had been
acquired by COLONE and so recorded in the registry.     Furthermore, the legal
opinion, required by Section 8.02 of the Loan Agreement, included a statement
that the State of Maranhao had transferred to COLONE all the title deeds to
the land making up the project area free and unencumbered, without fees,
charges and duties.

27.       Thus having obtained the necessary documents and legal opinion, the
loan was declared effective.    The retrospective view of Government and Bank
officials knowledgeable about land matters is that, at the time, tpe State
of Maranhao should have followed the discrimination procedures-        before
title of the land could be transferred to COLONE.       Two questions arise:
first, what should the Bank do if it belatedly discovers that a condition of
effectiveness has been improperly met; and second, did the Bank pay enough
attention to land titling arrangements initially?

28.        As   to   the   first   question,     the   Legal   Department's   opinion   is   as
follows:

     "It is incorrect to state that if one discovers later that an effective-
     ness condition has been 'improperly fulfilled' the Bank has not consi-
     dered the consequences.   If the evidence of fulfillment of an effective-
     ness condition has been furnished in good faith and there is no
     fraudulent misrepresentation, in connection therewith, as seems to be the
     case here, the loan must remain effective.    Other remedies may then be
     found among the covenants in the Loan and Project Agreements which have
     not been complied with.!2/



1/   The discrimination process is the specific procedure provided for in
     Brazilian law for determining Government and private rights to land.
     This procedure is public, carried out on a block basis, and resolves
     competing claims to land between Government and private parties, or
     among private claimants, on an administrative or a judicial basis. The
     procedure itself cannot be stopped by third party action.      Due to its
     general and public nature, it is very unlikely that final decisions would
     be contested, although this is a possibility (albeit remote) for up to a
     15-year period after the close of the discrimination process.     In addi-
     tion to resolving claims to lands, the discrimination process permits the
     State to obtain for its own use lands previously under irregular private
     occupancy.

29.        As to the second question, the audit concludes that the Bank paid
insufficient attention to the issue of land titling during preparation,
appraisal and initial project implementation.       It was known as early as
October 1972 that there was a problem with claims to COLONE land.        Then,
a supervision mission reported that the State Government faced a series of
claims from people on the land it had transferred to COLONE.       Yet, COLONE
took no action, partly because of its relative isolation and partly because
there was insufficient knowledge about the issue in the Bank which, therefore,
did not urge them to do so. COLONE realized eventually that land transfer had
been defective.   It tried to have it revalidated by INCRA (representatives of
the Federal Government) or by the State itself; however, neither of them
wanted to bring discrimination procedures to court.    It was only in 1977 and
1978 that legal procedures (acao discriminatorio and acao demarcatoria) were
instituted, municipality by municipality.   Following publication of the final
court document in late 1979, COTERMA (the state land institute) started
demarcation in 1980 but progressed slowly because of lack of funds. However,
COLONE was able to provide provisional titles to a first group of settlers.
As late as April 1981 it was noted that "resolution of remaining land titles
through 'discriminatoria' and 'demarcatoria' legal proceedings for the re-
mainder of sub-area II (would) continue to move forward (slowly) in the
State courts.   However, such legal proceedings continue to be costly, partic-
ularly in staff time, to COLONE".1/

30.        Under the follow-on Maranhao project alternative methods to speed up
matters regarding land ownership have been developed.     "The procedure in the
Alto Turi area would exclude the discrimination step, including instead a
special process of negotiations with unauthorized occupiers, following a
protocol established between COLONE and the State.      The negotiations would
define the area of land the irregular occupiers would be permitted to retain
and the amount of compensation to be paid to the settlers for improvements
made on the land returned to COLONE.     Registration of irregular occupiers in
sub-area I of Alto Turi has been completed ... , and steps are being taken by
COLONE and INCRA to declare Alto Turi a priority area for purposes of agrarian
reform.   A condition of loan effectiveness would be that an area of at least
10,000 hectares, including at least three of the fifteen largest plots irregu-
larly occupied in the Alto Turi area, had been recovered by COLONE on terms
satisfactory to the Bank".2/

31.       In general, land titling was a negative project experience, which in
the audit's view, however, had a positive aspect.      Had the discrimination
procedure been used, it is unlikely that the project could ever have been

      assurances were obtained that agreements to settle the claims of irregu-
      lar occupiers over 60 ha would be reached not later than March 1, 1983
      for those in sub-area I, and not later than December 31, 1983 for those
      in sub-areas II and III.
                                  - 12 -


declared effective.   Albeit late, the Bank has learned from the Alto Turi
experience and obtained a far better understanding about the intricacies
of land tenure and titling.   This has resulted in the inclusion of substan-
tial numbers of land regularization and redistri,ution components in recent
rural development projects in Northeast Brazil.-P Given the fact that land
and its distribution has been recopnized as an important factor for the
economic development of the Northeast_ this must be regarded as an important
benefit.

C.   Interest Rate

32.       At the time the project was approved, the Bank's Regional Office was
strongly promoting positive real interest rates for agricultural credit.3/
However, in the case of agricultural credit for poor and smaller farmers, it
was reluctantly prepared to forego this objective and to agree that "credit to
project settlers would be subsidized.      Loans would be unindexed and bear
interest of 7% per annum although the present annual inflation rate, which may
continue for some time, is about 20%.    Credit subsidization has been a long-
standing policy of Government in its objective of inducing agricultural
development, particularly in the Northeast; the Government is firmly committed
to this policy ....    It would be virtually impossible, both politically and
administratively, to establish a loan structure on an unsubsidized basis
for the limited area of this particular project" .4    While credit subsidiza-
tion was generally regarded as an undesirable practice, it was accepted in the
case of this project because:

         "(a)   participating farmers would be a particularly poor segment
                of the community, and would have no financial resources of
                their own which they could use for other purposes due to
                the provision of credit;

          (b)   credit would not induce settlers to substitute capital for
                labor, as it would be used only for cattle and fencing pur-
                chases and rice marketing;

          (c)    credit would be restricted to the minimum required to ensure
                 a satisfactory level of income for project participants;

          (d)    participants would receive medium-term credit for a period
                 of two years and thereafter would be ineligible for further
                 credit from project funds; and

          (e)    the financial resources of the credit institution (BNB) would
                 not be adversely affected, as the credit fund would be financed
                 directly from Government budgets."1/

33.       The Bank did not disburse against the agricultural credit component
(Loan Agreement; Schedule 1).   In July 1971, (before the appraisal mission's
departure) at a staff meeting, it was "felt that there is no justification for
using Bank resources to re-lend to settlers at 7 percent.     For one thing, 7
percent nominal would imply a large negative rate of interest, for Brazil
involving an open ended subsidy for the project.   Secondly, Brazil has enough
resources of its own for financing agricultural credit operations in the
Northeast and Bank resources for the credit operations would not be a critical
factor for success of the colonization project."2/        The decision not to
allow Bark funds to be re-lent at negative interest rates was later corr-
firmed.3    "However, in case the appraisal shows that interest rate subsidi-
zation is, in fact, likely to cause resource misallocation       then the Bank
would find itself unable to support the project in any way."4/ The apprais-
al mission did in fact accept the justification for subsidized credit to
small/poor farmers (see PPAM para. 32 above) and it became part of the proj-
ect, but wholly financed by Brazilian funds.

34.       As it turned out, the Alto Turi project was the first of a series of
rural development projects in Northeast Brazil.       Subsidized credit posed
problems for the Bank in all of these projects, but the issue was handled
differently (see Table 3).     Under the Lower Sao Francisco Polders Project
(Loan 1153-BR) and its succesor, Sao Francisco Irrigation II (Loan 1729-BR),
credit was not included as a project component; the Bank was satisfied
that credit was readily available from established sources. Only an assurance
was included in the first project that Government would ensure that funds for
credit were available if needed.      During the period 1975-80, credit was
included under the rural development projects; and the Bank financed this
credit even though it was recognized that interest rates were subsidized.  But
since it was mainly for small and poor farmers, the Bank's view then was that

4/   Internal    memorandum   dated   November   11,   1971   reporting   on discussions
     between    the Bank and the Brazilian Minister of Finance in October 1971.

it would not result in misallocation of resources.      Further, under these
projects, the Bank has placed an upper limit on subloans eligible for dis-
bursements and intended to establish strong credit monitoring systems.     In
1980, the Bank again changed its position:     credit was no longer regarded
as being eligible for disbursements, nor were incremental credit requirements
included under project costs. Increased inflation made the continued subsidi-
zation of smallholder credit no longer acceptable to the Bank, but it never-
theless required assurances that credit would be available on the same terms
as for other similar development projects.

35.       Thus, the Bank's approach to the issue of credit to smallholders
has changed many times, often in contradictory, confusing directions - to be
sure, in a far from settled and consistent fiscal environment.   The implica-
tions of these changes for rural development projects in Northeast Brazil can
perhaps be summed up as follows:

     (a)   Credit to smallholders is no longer included as a significant
           component.  The Bank's contribution to "total" project costs is, in
           fact, lower than stated (33%); it is probably closer to 20% of the
           overall costs.l/

     (b)   Care must be taken in determining actual real unit costs of rural
           development projects in Northeast Brazil and especially in comparing
           the unit costs of the various rural development projects.

     (c)   While excluding credit from credit costs, and thus from the financ-
           ing plan, might increase the Bank's leverage in its dialogue with
           Government about agricultural credit policies, it might reduce at
           the same time the Bank's leverage about the execution of the credit
           component.2/


1/   The Region disagrees with these figures (which were derived by the audit
     on the basis of appraisal figures).   Actual experience with these credit
     components suggests that appraisal estimates of project-related credit
     have been too optimistic by as much as one third.

2/   The Region disagrees with the audit's view.    They argue that comparison
     between projects "with" or "without" credit components reveal no signif-
     icant differences in credit availability.    Furthermore, they feel that
     Bank efforts with the Central Bank to improve small farmer credit pro-
     cedures probably have more impact than Bank financing of components.
     They also point out that beyond such improvement and supervision atten-
     tion to credit, the Bank has little leverage as the Bank-financed credit
     share of the POLONORDESTE program is simply too small.      Finally, they
     point out that disbursements are held at the Central Bank and are pooled
     with other funds; thus disbursements do not go to the operating banks
     where most problems remain, particularly at the branch level.

D.   Supervision

36.       The project has been the subject of a special study on supervision,
also referred to in detail in the PCR (paras. 11.03-11.06).      The relevant
parts of the case study have been attached to this audit memorandum as Annex
1. This case study covers the project implementation period,,until 1978, and
its conclusions remain valid, although some improvements were made later in
1979-80, in that more agencies outside COLONE were contacted either in person
or by mail.   The supervision was, nevertheless, one of relative "isolation,"
continuing the trend manifest during preparation and appraisal.

37.       However, there were some very positive aspects of project super-
vision. Excellent cooperation between the highways and agricultural divisions
ensured sufficient and competent supervision of the feeder roads component
which was well implemented.     These arrangements, formalized in the Latin
America and the Caribbean Region, could be usefully applied to other projects
or components--for example, education and health components.l/

38.       There was excellent staff continuity in the beginning between
appraisal and supervision, followed by a period of discontinuity caused mainly
by the Bank's reorganization; regrettably, coinciding witli a period of major
changes in project concept.   Continuity was restored from late 1974 onwards:
the same project officer was responsible for supervision until project comple-
tion.2 /  This resulted in excellent relations with the project executing
agency.   But insufficient additional expertise was added to supervision
missions:   no financial analyst, education specialist, health specialist, or
anthropologist has even visited the project; a forester participated in
supervision only once as did an architect, the latter relatively late during
project implementation.

39.       SUDENE had originally started settlement in the area, but, as the
supervision case study points out, SUDENE was not informed regularly about
project implementation, especially in the beginning.      This was a serious
omission as SUDENE was designated as the representative of the Borrower.3/
Many agencies (such as INCRA, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Finance, and
SUBIN--the international relations department of the Secretariat of Planning)
had an interest in the project, but as the case study points out, they were
only rarely consulted.   Some of the agencies undertook their own supervision,
but there was hardly any coordination between their efforts and the Bank's.
Communications improved somewhat towards the end of the implementation period.


1/   Another example might be between IDF and agricultural divisions regarding
     agro-industrial credit projects.    (See PPAR - Brazil Agro-Industries
     Credit Project, Loan 924-BR, OED report under preparation and PPAR -
     Costa Rica Second Agricultural Credit Project, Loan 827-CR, OED Report
     No. 3492, dated June 10, 1981.)

2/   Also, the same highway engineer supervised the road component for most of
     the period.

40.       Interested and involved agencies must be kept informed, even if it
requires additional time.  In other regions, all interested agencies usually
participate in the supervision missions' wrap-up meetings.    Moreover, even
though COLONE's responsibilities were to be handed over to existing state
institutions and agencies, contact with them was sporadic; this important
aspect of the project was insufficiently supervised.   As during preparation
and appraisal, insufficient attention was given during supervision to the
institutional environment.

E.   Reporting to the Board

41.       Project implementation and Bank activities   related to it are      re-
ported to the Board of Directors in two ways:

     (a)   the status of projects under implementation is mentioned    in each
           President's Report;

     (b)   Bank actions in relation to project implementation    are   part   of
           the Bi-Monthly Report on Bank and IDA Operations.

References to the Alto Turi Land Settlement Project made in President's
Reports issued during the 1972-82 period are in Annex 2. In preparing this
part of the President's Report, which describes the status of projects in
execution, the following are the guidelines:

     "These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
     the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
     problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
     remedy them.   They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
     standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
     strengths and weaknesses in project execution."

42.       Legal complications in transferring land titles, a major problem
throughout project execution, were only mentioned since early 1980, although
they became an issue much earlier.   Problems encountered were duly reported,
but there is little mention of remedial actions being taken or contemplated.
It was found by the audit that most of these reports tended to be repeti-
tive,1/ which may be unavoidable under the present system in countries with
large lending programs.   In this context reference is made to a recent Board
discussion where the extent of the Bank's paper flow and cost of producing
almost identical papers were discussed.2/


1/   An example is the reference to COLONE's revised farm development plans
     which is repeated, uniformly, from June 1974 to June 1979, while in fact
     it does not provide the reader with a great deal of information.

2/   Mentioned during a Board discussion regarding two credits to Upper Volta
     for two agricultural development projects.   See:  Summary of Discussions
     at the Meeting of the Executive Directors of the Bank and IDA, July 27,
     1982, SDb2-41, dated August 13, 1982, especially paras. 62-64.
                                    - 17 -


43.        The bi-monthly report to the Executive Directors on Bank and IDA
operations contains references to projects under implementation, but only in
relation to their signing, effectiveness and closing, and visits by Bank
staff.   References to the Alto Turi project over the period July 1972 - June
1982 have been assembled in Annex 3. The relevance of this information can
only be properly assessed by the recipients of the report.    The audit, how-
ever, notes that the report has grown in size along with the growth of Bank
operations while the message contents have become more concise.      The audit
suggests that a review of present practice might prove useful to determine the
manner and extent of portfolio reporting.

F.   Environment

44.       An in-depth review of the environmental, especially the human
and ecological, dimensions of the project is not possible since specific
expertise was not available to the audit mission. However, a few perspectives
can be usefully developed.

45.       Forestry and Ecology.      Environmental   objectives   detailed   in   the
appraisal report were as follows:

     "In line with present Government policy to leave a substantial part of the
      Amazon area under forest to protect the environment, two blocks totalling
      100,000 ha of forest would be retained in the poorest and topographically
      most difficult lands in the project area north of the Turiacu river.
      These blocks would be surveyed, legally set aside, and timber exploita-
      tion would be permitted only on a controlled basis.      About 90% of the
      land cleared under the project would be planted to permanent pasture and
      this would help prevent erosion and control runoff.       Gauges would be
      installed to check the possible effects of land clearing on rainfall
      and on runoff. These measurements would yield useful preliminary infor-
      mation regarding important effects of deforestation."''/

46.       Sawmill and logging operations have been expanded as planned (PCR
paras. 4.18-4.19).  The appraisal mission intended that a senior forester in
COLONE should supervise the forestry program.  The May 1975 supervision mis-
sion recommended that a forestry department be established.   But although a
suitable expatriate candidate was identified, he could not be employed due
to problems of double taxation.   Only a 12,000 ha forest reserve was estab-
lished, and even then there have been continuing problems with encroachment
and illegal occupancy by squatters.2 /    It is unlikely that the original

2/   Under the follow-on project, fences would be constructed around the
     perimeter and access and boundary clearing would be improved. Patrols
     would be established to keep out squatters.
                                  -   18 -



objective will ever be achieved, even under the follow-on project.l/   There
is also no indication that much study was done under the project into the
effects of land clearing and pasture development on runoff and soil erosion.

47.       The audit mission noted, while driving on the BR-316 and project
area roads, the nearly continuous area of secondary shrubs and bushes; only a
few blackened remnants of tall tropical trees have remained. In the knowledge
that this area was only recently covered by tropical forests, the visual
impression forcefully underscores the environmental impact of this and similar
projects.   Thus, although the project has not demonstrated the "means of
preserving a balance between developing new land and retaining the ameliora-
tive effects of forest areas and pasture, 2/ its environmental objectives
remain as valid as ever and much remains to be done to achieve them.

48.       The failure of the environmental component is to a large extent also
due to the fact that insufficient allowance was made for it at appraisal.
While there were clearly established environmental objectives, they were not
translated into actual components in the implementation plan, neither were
they costed under the project; this should have been done.

49.       Amerindians.    The subject was discussed during Board presentation
when a question of what would happen to the indigenous population in the area
was raised.   It was stated that 2,800 settlers, already in the area, would be
absorbed into the project; it was then believed that there were no Indian
tribes in the project area although it was always known that some lived in
adjacent areas:

     "Adjacent to the project area there are 3,000 km2 of land considered
     suitable for colonization.      The area is inhabited by about 10,000
     indigenous Indians and about one-half of the 3 million hectares would be
     reserved for them; the other half would be colonized as the national and
     state highways are constructed in the area. 3/

As early as 1975, Amerindian families were reported living in        the area,
causing problems, including casualties, which temporarily halted     settlement
activities in the area concerned.    The problem was due mainly to   inaccurate
original surveying.   It was finally resolved through a boundary     correction
between the COLONE and FUNAI territories:



1/   Although that project includes the identification, protection and manage-
     ment of two new forest reserves, expected to total about 100,000 ha,
     these reserves are to be in two of this project's sub-areas: Baixada and
     Alto Turi (sub-area III - the expansion area).

     "The previous problems which had been encountered with Indian settlers
     of the "Urubu Kaapo" tribe, have now been satisfactorily solved and
     actually informal technical assistance and emergency health service
     arrangements between COLONE/FUNAI have brought about a certain coopera-
     tion between the two agencies. "l/

In view of the increasing emphasis in the Bank on human ecological considera-
tions related to economic development and tribal people,2/ it would have
seemed natural for the follow-on project to develop this cooperation further.
Even though the Office of Environmental Affairs emphasized its potential,3/
the follow-on project did not include such a component.   Instead, Amerindian
protection was a complementary activity4 /:

     "Although the project area does not include any land set aside for
     Amerindian reserves, there are two such reserves situated sufficiently
     close to the project area to be potentially influenced by development
     within the area.   Both these reserves lie within the influence area of
     the Carajas - Sao Luis railroad now under construction.    In conjunction
     with the proposed Bank support for the Carajas project, a Special Program
     has been formulated by the Federal Government to protect Amerindians in
     the influence area of the railroad in addition to the provision of basic
     services to the Amerindian population.      The proposed Maranhao Rural
     Development Project would complement these activities with the provision
     of supporting health care on request as has been the case in the past in
     the Alto Turi area, and collaboration in the demarcation of one of the
     reserve boundaries shared with the Alto Turi subproject area. Assurances
     were obtained from the Federal Government that it would take all neces-
     sary measures to put into effect the actions included in the Special
     Program for protecting the Alto Turi and Rio Pindare Amerindian reserves,
     to ensure that the provisions of the Indian Statute (Law 6001) were
     observed."5/

50.       Not only does it seem strange to ask a Government to implement its
own laws and statutes, but the Bank also missed, in the audit's view, the
opportunity to integrate a tribal component in a rural/regional development

project.l/   A special program was included under the Carajas Iron Ore Pro-
ject,2/ which, at a cost of US$13.6 million!/ for land protection, health,
administration, economic development, and educatior4/, aimed at minimizing
immediate and long-term adverse impacts of accelerated regional development on
Amerindians.   While the potential benefits of such a component are not in
doubt, it is, in the audit's view, more an isolated effort and not part of a
rural development project.5/    The Maranhao project would have provided an
opportunity to make a systematic start in that direction by attempting to
institutionalize contacts between FUNAI and COLONE, which at present are only
on a personal level, and with some other agencies responsible for rural
development. This needs further attention.
G.     Road Development6/
51.        The project included a substantial road component, and most of the
Bank   loan was disbursed for this component--see Table 1.    At appraisal it

3/     The subcomponent covers activities in 14 reserve areas with an estimated
       population of about 4,500; thus the resulting incremental costs per
       beneficiary are about US$3,100.

4/     A major immediate effort to protect Guaja Indians living in small bands
       around certain reserves was also included.

5/     The Region disagrees with the audit's view that including a special
       program under the Carajas project makes it an isolated effort.   In fact,
       they argue that a substantial component under one project provides better
       leverage and a better chance of success than more limited components
       scattered over various rural development projects.

6/     OPS staff have provided the following observations on this issue:
       "The original road designs were consistent with the preparation/apprais-
       al objectives of a low cost approach to settlement which could be widely
       replicated.   This objective seems to have been forgotten during imple-
       mentation and indeed SUDENE policy makers may never have been convinced
       that such an approach, which would bear limited political rewards,
       was the correct way to go. With regard to the geometric layout, this was
       used at preparation for estimation purposes because of lack of topo-
       graphic data - surveys had only been carried out on traces at 2 km
       intervals.   The alignments of roads and farm boundaries in these sorts
       of situations need to be finalized as the area is opened up and one
       would expect on-site engineering supervisors to make whatever changes
       are needed to avoid building roads in swamps or straight up steep
       slopes."    While it is true that appraisal designs were low-cost, it
       remains a fact that final and detailed road design was far beyond
       standards set at appraisal and followed a rigid geometric pattern.
                                 - 21 -


was envisaged that 305 km of penetration and access roads and trails would be
built and 80 km of access roads would be improved.       Consultants would be
employed for design work and to supervise construction.  Construction would be
by contractors selected through international competitive bidding.     Mainte-
nance would be the responsibility of the State Road Department.

52.        Substantially delayed, only about 77% of the road component was
completed.    Consultants were engaged in June 1975, prequalification of con-
tractors took place in late 1975, and a contract for the first 102 km was
signed in June 1976.    A default by the first contractor ensued, resulting in
further delays in execution; all this adding up to sizeable cost increases.
Eventually, these forced the scaling-down of the program from 305 km to 238
km. It was completed in 1979.

53.       Although road maintenance was to be undertaken by the State (Loan
Agreement, Section 4.03), nothing has been done to date.     The State Road
Department's attitude was that since they were not consulted during the
planning of the project, they could not allocate resources from an already
inadequate budget.

54.       Two issues arise.    First, the roads under the project have been
overdesigned.   The appraisal report specified designs, but those were con-
siderably exceeded during construction. This was accepted by the Bank without
much debate: none of the supervision reports raises this issue. The PCR even
notes (para. 12.08) that over-design is advantageous because roads sub-
sequently last longer even without adequate maintenance. This point, however,
needs further study.

55.       Second, settlement followed a rigid pattern: lot sizes with a depth
of 2,500 meters and a road frontage of 150 meters.   This resulted in settlers
not being given farms with similar potential and also caused roads to be
constructed in straight lines, without any regard for geographical contours or
natural obstacles such as marshy areas and hills.    A little more flexibility
to determine plot shapes and actual location of roads seems warranted in
settlement projects.l/

     approach roads must be aligned according to topography and not on an
     arbitrary geometric pattern.

     reproduced verbatim in this Annex, and no updating has been done by the
     audit mission.   Since the case study was done more than two years ago,
     some of its conclusions have become obsolete.   For example (see Annex 1,
     para. 3.02 last sentence) the Bank has now a far better understanding of
     the intricacies of land tenure and titling (see PPAM, para. 31). Also on
     the subject of supervision, see PPAM, paras. 36-40.

                        II. SUPERVISION OPERATIONS


A.   Supervision Missions

2.01       Two Bank divisions were involved in supervising the project, and
their relations and performance were satisfactory. The only perceived differ-
ence in performance between the two stemmed from their priority in allocating
resources.    Whereas the Agriculture Division was forthcoming with the neces-
sary resources to supervise the project, the Highway Division sometimes had
difficulties in making staff available for missions at the times planned by
the Agriculture Division.

2.02      Twenty supervision missions visited the project between October 1972
and September 1978, with an average interval of 3.8 months between missions.
The longest gap between missions was eight months and the shortest gap one
month. On the average, missions lasted a week and included two experts. (For
a si=mary of supervision inputs, see Table 2.)    For purposes of discussion,
project supervision can be divided into two stages: late 1972 - mid 1974, and
mid 1974 to late 1978.    Details of staffing and assignments for supervision
missions are given in Attachment A.

     1.   First Stage

2.03       The first year and a half of project supervision was a time of
indecision which coincided with a slow and somewhat rocky start to the pro-
ject.   Although the appraisal mission leader (an agriculturalist) supervised
the project twice before effectiveness--essentially to check on the conditions
of effectiveness and to prepare for start up--he left for another Bank assign-
ment about the time the project became effective, and his experience was lost.
The Division could not easily find a replacement for him, and the next three
missions had no continuity, either in terms of personnel or expertise. Five
of the six staff members who participated in those three missions visited the
project for the first and only time.      Neither continuity nor a sense of
grasping the nature of the project and its problems are evident from an
examination of supervision during that period:      a factor in this was the
reorganization the Bank was undergoing at the time.

2.04      This was a particularly critical stage in the project which was
adversely affected by poor supervision, for it was at that time when Brazilian
officials at all levels began to assert that the low cost, self-help model on
which the project was based was not feasible in the Brazilian context. As an
alternative, COLONE prepared new farm models on a more intensive--and far more
expensive-pattern. This would mean completely changing the low cost approach
to colonization which the project was trying to demonstrate, and jeopardizing
its replicability. The new farm development models required sub-loans 8 times
larger than anticipated at appraisal, and hence either the total project cost
would rise significantly or the number of beneficiaries would have to be
severely reduced.    Such a significant change in project concept, design,
scope, cost and most certainly, profitability, should have called for a full
                                   -   27   -
                                                                       ANNEX 1
                                                                       Page 3 of 10
project re-appraisal.    However, the third mission approved the change and
recorded the action in the back-to-office and full report.        Headquarters
showed no reaction, implicitly endorsing the approved change. Even though it
had solved a major impasse, this ill-considered decision--which was adopted by
a Programs staff member and one from Projects who possessed no prior experi-
ence with the project--distorted project design and contributed to problems
which would later affect implementation.

2.05      The analyst concludes that the missions immediately following did
little to help the situation. Neither did they insist on a detailed explana-
tion of why the original models had proven unfeasible, nor did they recognize
the deep-seated factors which were to further delay project implementation.
The supervision reports also show that these missions had an inadequate
knowledge of crucial project concepts.
     2.   Second Stage
2.06      From mid-1974 onwards supervision began to improve in all respects.
Thirteen regular missions visited the project between then and late 1978,
usually composed of a single agriculturalist and engineer. Continuity was
strong, and missions were properly staffed and spaced.      The same agricul-
turalist participated in all missions but one, and of the eight visits by a
highway engineer, seven were paid by the same individual.     A third expert,
usually an agriculturalist, accompanied this basic team on five occasions.
This pattern was broken only once, when a four-man mission (the two regulars
plus a forestry expert and an agricultural economist) went into the field.
The expanded mission had no particular impact on implementation.     Only two
consultants had a role in supervision:    the forestry expert and one of the
agriculturalists.
     3.   Main Issues Pertaining to Supervision Missions
2.07      Most mission members had commitments to Bank projects in addition to
Alto Turi. Among the agricultural personnel, several were variously involved
with identification, preparation, and appraisal of other projects, as well as
project supervision. The highway officer always had additional responsibili-
ties. Most of his visits to Alto Turi were part of itineraries that included
other projects, and other countries.

2.08      Programs staff participated in three missions. They seemed to have
little impact on project execution except for the instance mentioned in the
first phase (see para. 2.04).     The presence in the third mission of the
Programs officer, who had been a loan officer since before the loan was
approved, seems to have been aimed at providing continuity.

2.09     There were also two one-man missions from Controllers. No special
project needs called for these visits, which were simply part of a much
larger itinerary devoted to checking disbursements in several projects.

2.10      Terms of reference were clear and explicit, spelling out in detail
most of the tasks to be performed; they reflected the project situation and
needs as the Bank perceived them at the time. Adequate notice was given to

COLONE of the missions' arrival, a fact which was readily acknowledged by
COLONE officials themselves; occasionally cables were sent to other agencies.
Most of the cables did not spell out explicitly the prospective mission's main
areas of concern, but the strong continuity that began in the second stage on
both sides (the same man has headed COLONE all throughout project implementa-
tion) made it almost unnecessary.      COLONE always took all the necessary
preparatory actions.

2.11       COLONE was the focal point of all missions.   Its headquarters were
visited by every mission with two exceptions, and even then the missions met
elsewhere with COLONE's Director President.      Typically, mission time was
divided equally between headquarters and the project area (usually two days in
each), and was sufficient for carrying out supervision. Most of the time was
spent discussing technical, managerial, and financial problems with COLONE's
personnel.

2.12      COLONE personnel interviewed for this case study responded very
favorably to Bank supervision.   Although they disliked the initial lack of
continuity, the strong continuity that was established after the fifth mis-
sion, coupled with the fact that COLONE itself maintained a high degree of
staff stability, contributed to a very positive experience.  They found the
Bank staff competent, knowledgeable and personally suited to their tasks.
Advance warning of the missions' itineraries was always received, and while
these may have lacked specific references to particular issues to be dis-
cussed, COLONE staff stated that the congenial and continuous relationship
somewhat made up for this.

2.13      COLONE staff noted only two problems: a lack of authority to solve
problems in the field and a lack of flexibility. The first observation arose
from the fact that often the Bank technician agreed in principle with the
urgency of a certain decision, but could not authorize its implementation. It
was felt that the delays this problem occasioned were quite serious and
involved a substantial "cost" to the project.     COLONE staff also felt that
mission members were too rigid in using the appraisal report to measure
project accomplishments.   This procedure was not effective since, in their
opinion, the project had not been properly appraised in the first place.

2.14      Although mission staff were comprehensive in their supervision
of COLONE and the project site, they failed to systematically visit the rest
of the agencies relevant for project implementation, and this proved to be a
problem.   Both the Ministry of the Interior and the Central Bank had been
visited under the first supervision stage, but visits were discontinued in
January 1975.   The Ministry of Finance and INCRA were. visited only once each,
and SUDENE was visited three times.

2.15      The most serious omissions by far were those of INCRA and SUDENE.
INCRA, as the official settlement agency of the Govenment, has the mandate
to appraise and approve every settlement project in Brazil, and no project
exists without INCRA's approval.   The Bank had not recognized this, however,
and failed to involve INCRA in the preparation and appraisal of the Alto Turi
Project.   The oversight was carried into implementation and supervision.
                                   - 29 -                            ANNEX 1
                                                                     Page 5 of 10


Although INCRA's role had by then become self evident, and although implemen-
tation was totally or partly delayed twice for one full year each timel/as a
result of the time it took INCRA to grant its approval, only one mission
ever visited INCRA.   Even this visit is not mentioned explicitly in the super-
vision report.    Through its lack of contact with INCRA, the Bank lost its
chance to discuss with INCRA its objections on project design and to act
toward accelerating INCRA's approval procedures.

2.16      SUDENE, whose role was equally important, was similarly overlooked.
It had been SUDENE, under the Ministry of Interior, who had originally con-
ceived the project and who had to procure the financial resources to fund
both COLONE and the project.     SUDENE also acted as the intermediary between
COLONE and the Ministry of Interior, and through this one with all other
government agencies--including the Ministry of Finance (which was to provide
the project's counterpart financing, but never did), and the Central Bank
(which was to finance half of the total project costs:        farm development
credit).   Project financing was the main topic discussed during the three
visits.   This had considerable impact in at least one instance and caused
the immediate release of a considerable sum to COLONE which in turn allowed
them to repay a short-term debt.

2.17      SUDENE staff interviewed, who admit a cordial and close relationship
with the Bank on other projects, do not have a clear impression of Bank super-
vision on Alto Turi.    They admit finding it difficult to establish contact
with the Bank to discuss problems and find common ground for overcoming them.
Officials interviewed said that they were not informed of mission arrival, and
that Bank officials visiting COLONE's headquarters did not even visit SUDENE's
state representative--even though they were in the same town2 .     They would
have appreciated a more extensive dialogue with the Bank, which would have
covered more than just the project's financial problems. They state that more
intensive Bank contact with SUDENE, with some participation by SUDENE staff in
the Bank supervision effort, would have resulted in a better understanding and
greater support by SUDENE for the project.31

1/   The revised project document was submitted to INCRA first in December
     1973, and again in February 1974 after changes had been made per INCRA's
     request; it was eventually approved in December 1974.  Later the project
     had to be modified to substitute for land occupied by Indians, and
     amended plans for settlement were submitted to INCRA in early 1976.   No
     INCRA authorization had been received by mid-1977, and there is no
     further reference to this issue in the files.
2/   Bank staff claim that visits were not made to SUDENE's state representa-
     tive in Maranhao.
3/   Arrangements were made for SUDENE staff to co-supervise the project
     in mid-1978, but heated discussions over who was to blame for the lack
     of funding prevented effective discussions between the Bank, COLONE
     and SUDENE.   Field visits were equally fruitless as SUDENE staff were
     unfamiliar with project goals and on-site works.     Despite this rocky
     start it was hoped that co-supervision efforts would improve with time.
                                                                    ANNEX 1
                                   30-                              Page 6 of 10


2.18      Correspondence distribution was as biased toward COLONE as the
mission visits.    COLONE received a letter after every mission which sent
letters; it was the sole recipient of Bank correspondence about half the time.
COLONE acknowledged receiving the follow-up letters and stated that, with only
one exception, they contained no surprises when compared with the field
visits.   By contrast, SUDENE received only two regular follow-up letters,
which, because of the lack of contact with the missions, were of little use to
them.   It was also mentioned that Bank missions did not check on previous
requirements or commitments.

2.19      Since most missions only visited COLONE, no wrap up meetings were
required.   Aide memoires between COLONE and the Bank were prepared for most
missions, and were found to be extremely useful by COLONE personnel. Back-to-
office reports were prepared by seven missions, or about one-third; they were
combined with full reports in another three cases. For the most part, satis-
factory reports were produced and issued within six weeks after the mission's
visit to the project. By and large the reports in the second stage are
accurate and comprehensive, and bring out a clear picture of the developments
at project level, which is in contrast to the poor reporting of the earlier
stage.
2.20      Letters to the government were issued promptly after the missions.
In only two cases in the second stage, letters were never sent--after the two
Controllers' missions. Cables were also sent to the relevant ministers imme-
diately after two missions, requesting immediate action on project financing.
B.   Other Supervision Work
     1.   By the Bank
2.21      In addition to the eighteen regular supervision missions two other
visits were paid which were not considered as "supervision missions."    One
of these in late 1977, by the Director of the Programs II Department, the
Brazilian Division Chief and the relevant loan officer, resulted in a cable
being sent to the Secretary General of the Ministry of Planning, urging him
to exercise his best personal efforts to ensure funds reached the COLONE
projects.

2.22      In May the following year a Bank lawyer visited the project to
learn more about the legal issues surrounding the release of titles to land
in the project area.

2.23      A Bank project officer is stationed at SUDENE headquarters, but his/
her terms of reference do not include supervision of ongoing projects, being
fully occupied in rural development project identification and preparation.
     2.   By the Borrower
2.24      INCRA and SUDENE both carried out their own supervision of the
project.   INCRA claimed eight missions from 1974 to 1978, while SUDENE seems
to have supervised both COLONE and the project at least once a vear since the
                                    - 31 -                              ANNEX 1
                                                                        Page 7 of 10

project's inception.  The Bank made no effort to coordinate its efforts with
that of the Brazilian agencies, to exchange information with them, or request
supervision reports from them.     SUTDENE staff interviewed felt this was a
serious oversight.

2.25      COLONE sent satisfactory quarterly reports to the Bank, but COLONE
staff interviewed felt they should be simplified and shortened.   Bank staff
always acknowledged receiving the reports and appeared to have a good under-
standing of them.   COLONE staff had one suggestion which they thought would
facilitate matters:   that every prospective mission ask in advance for the
additional information it may require, which would enable COLONE to prepare
it in advance and, if so agreed, incorporate it regularly into the quarterly
reports.


                      III.   THE IMPACT OF SUPERVISION


A.   Supervision of Obligations Under the Loan and Project Agreements

3.01      There is little record of whether the covenants have been complied
with or not. Compliance with covenants on the operation and management of the
project cooperatives and those on procurement procedures seem to have been
properly supervised, although supervision reports contain no explicit state-
ment on the status of compliance at any given moment. Loan covenants appear
not to have been systematically reviewed.

3.02       It is apparent, however, that two loan covenants of major import-
ance and a condition of effectiveness have not been complied with, and that,
moreov-er, Bank supervision has been weak in dealing with those problems.
First, it was a condition of effectiveness that the State Government transfer
to COLONE title to all land comprising the project area, free of encumbrances.
The Bank was furnished with documentary evidence on the transfer, but one
condition of the transfer had not been fulfilled. As a consequence, COLONE's
ownership rights on the project area can be challenged--and they have been.
But supervision missions failed to report these problems, which COLONE faced
fairly early in the project life when it tried to have the land registered
under its name.    The first reference to legal difficulties related to land
titling was in April 1977.     The findings of the Bank lawyer visiting the
project in May 1978 confirmed that the State Government had not complied with
the covenant on land titles, and that the borrower had bona fide misrepre-
sented to the Bank its accomplishment. It would appear however, that the Bank
has not fully analyzed the situation to satisfy itself that no corrective
measures exist, much less notified the borrower that it is aware of the
discrepancies and expecting them to adopt corrective measures.

3.03      The major loan covenant--"making available to COLONE, quarterly in
advance, such funds as shall be necessary for carrying out the project"--was
never complied with.     Supervision missions just recorded the fact that
counterpart financing was not forthcoming, but did very little to remedy
the situation, although the language in the Loan Agreement is abundantly clear
                                                              ANNEX 1
                                - 32 -                        Page 8 of 10


and extremely explicit.   The only remedial action taken boy the Bank was the
dispatch of a strongly worded cable following mission 161k.   This is a major
flaw of the Bank in supervising loan covenants--and the project itself.

3.04      The borrower also failed to comply with another financial covenant
which would provide SUDENE with all the necessary funds' for the schools and
health centers.    Again, the fact that such funding was not forthcoming is
mentioned in the supervision reports, but there is no explicit reference
to this as a breaching of a loan covenant.

3.05     Finally, no financial analyst ever participated in a supervision
mission.  COLONE, the cooperative accounts and the audits on them seem
to have been properly reviewed by the Bank staff only during mission 15.
B.   Implementation Assistance and Problem Solving
3.06      Execution of project works was properly supervised.   The project
site, as well as COLONE headquarters, were frequently visited.     Technical
problems confronted during execution and their possible solutions were
discussed.    The missions constituted an important technical channel and
sounding board for COLONE ideas for an otherwise almost completely isolated
project staff.
3.07      But the problems inhibiting project implementation originated out-
side COLONE, and supervision missions failed to confront them. Project execu-
tion was delayed twice by lack of INCRA's approval of COLONE's original or
amended settlement plans.     But INCRA was visited only once; no information
was requested from it; no correspondence was addressed to it (see paras.
2.15. and 2.18).   Insufficient counterpart financing--or the complete lack of
it--has been the most pervasive source of the project's problems.       Project
execution has been systematically delayed for this reason throughout the
the project life; COLONE was on the verge of bankruptcy a couple of times
because of that. But neither SUDENE nor the Ministries of Interior or Finance
were systematically called on for an explanation and for requesting them to
honor the Government commitment (see paras. 2.16 and 3.03).      Visits to the
two ministries were suspended after January 1975.    Only on a couple of occa-
sions (and mission 16 was particularly successful in this respect) did the
Bank contribute substantially to having some funding materialize.         Even-
tually, in mid-1977 the Ministry of Planning extended the project a lifeline
through its Program for the Development of Integrated Areas in the Northeast
(POLONORDESTE), but POLONORDESTE has been visited only twice.2/     Letters or
cables were very seldom addressed to all these crucial ministries and agencies
(see para. 2.18).

1/   Although no records exist on Alto Turi files, the Bank frequently raised
     the funding issue and other problems of Alto Turi with SUDENE and the
     Federal Government in general meetings on Bank-financed projects.
2/   POLONORDESTE officials interviewed by OED stated that although generally
     satisfied with the quality of Bank supervision, in terms of the number,
     frequency and continuity of the missions, they suggested that Bank super-
     vision missions should be accompanied by a Government official--someone
     entitled to commit the Government and adopt decisions.

3.08       SUDENE officials were particularly critical of the Bank's weak
stance vis-a-vis project problems.    In their view, the Bank was concerned
about the project's survival, and thus tempered its tone in discussing the
problems with the Government.   While admitting that mission members' sympa-
thetic approach and support has been crucial for project survival, officials
feel a more detached attitude and a stronger stance would have improved the
situation.
C.   Assisting Institution-Building
3.09      Bank supervision has played no major role in institution building.
The Bank has always supported the project and COLONE, but COLONE has developed
almost by itself into what it now is.
D.   The Learning Process
3.10       The Alto Turi project, as an experimental, pilot settlement project,
offers several lessons for the Bank to learn. These refer mainly to project
identification, preparation and appraisal--particularly in the institutional
area.   Most of these lessons have been learned and new agricultural projects
in Brazil have been handled in quite a different way:      preparation has been
proper and carried out mainly by Brazilian staff; Government commitment has
been secured from the very beginning; institutional arrangements have been
analyzed much more carefully.

3.11      Supervision history offers a very important lesson, too:  the agen-
cies whose actions or lack of them are originating, contributing to or com-
pounding a project's problems must be visited by supervision missions both to
know the reasons behind their behavior and to find workable solutions. Also,
they must be kept informed of the main project problems and developments
through follow-up letters and cables. This lesson was partly learned during
project implementation.    Letters and cables have been frequently sent to
Government after the sixteenth mission. Also, the last mission arranged for
two SUDENE staff members to meet it in Sao Luis for project supervision.


                             IV. CONCLUSIONS


4.01      In analyzing the impact of supervision on this project it is impor-
tant to reiterate that the project's structural and financial problems did
not originate during implementation.   They were built in during identifica-
tion, preparation and appraisal. The project was prepared by consultants; its
main elements (self-help, low cost settlement) were brought in by the Bank;
Brazilian input at either the state or federal level was absent.      SUDENE's
input was almost restricted to project identification.    Thus, it would have
been difficult for even a superior supervision effort to overcome these
problems!/!.


1/   Bank staff attribute the difficulties with enforcing covenants (see para.
     3.02) to the early difficulties with project design and appraisal.
                                  34 -
                                  -                               ANNEX 1
                                                                  Page 10 of 10


4.02      Even considering what supervision missions were up against, however,
they did not measure up.    In fact, they failed in exactly the same areas--
organizational and managerial--where preparation had been the weakest.     Not
only did the Bank allow a major change in the project concept and design
(from low cost to fairly capital intensive) without raising any objection, but
then proceeded to stand aside as the project deteriorated due to bureaucratic
errors over land settlement and a lack of essential counterpart funds.     The
only apparent solution--going to the various agencies which were the source of
the problems--was not taken early enough to fully overcome the difficulties.

4.03      There is reason to believe that the weak supervision of Alto Turi
has been more the exception than the rule when compared with other supervision
experiences.   First of all, although the various borrower staff interviewed
for this study rarely held a common viewpoint on Bank supervision, they were
all in agreement on the mission's lack of latitute and authority to make deci-
sions in the field.   This is not typical of Bank missions in general, which
generally are commended (or criticized) for their strong stance in the field.
Secondly, SUDENE's perception of the missions supervising Alto Turi differs
completely from its perception of missions supervising other Bank-financed
projects in the same Northeastern Region. The latter have worked very closely
with SUDENE, and as a consequence the state agencies involved in these pro-
jects feel strongly committed to their successful implementation.      On this
basis, it may be suggested that the weak supervision which characterized Alto

           STATUS OF PROJECT AS REPORTED IN PRESIDENT'S REPORTS

The Alto Turi Land Development Project     was   reported on   as   follows   in   the
President's Reports for:

Power Distribution (Ln. 887), approved April 10, 1973
"The loan became effective on February 15, 1973, and the project is proceeding
according to schedule."

Itumbiara Hydroelectric and Agro-Industries Credit (Lns. 923 and 924), ap-
  proved June 28 and July 5, 1973
"The loan became effective on February 15, 1973, and the project is slightly
behind schedule. A Bank supervision mission is scheduled to visit the project
in the near future and review the causes of delay."

Paulo Afonso Hydroelectric Power IV and Minas Gerais Water Supply (Lns. 1008
  and 1009), both approved June 4, 1974
"COLONE has prepared revised farm development plans whose credit component, to
be financed by public financial institutions, will be significantly higher
than originally estimated, although still low in comparison to other settle-
ment projects. Physical infrastructure is likely to be completed in 1974, and
it is anticipated that the project will be completed in 1978 as envisaged."

(Lns. 1067, 1074, 1075, 1151, 1152, 1153, 1171, 1195, 1206, 1207, 1249, 1256,
  1257, 1300, 1302, 1309, 1317, 1343, 1362, 1406 and 1411), approved Novem-
  ber 12, 1974 through April 26, 1977
"COLONE has prepared revised farm development plans whose credit component, to
be financed by public financial institutions, will be significantly higher
than originally estimated, although still low in comparison to other settle-
ment projects.  Administrative delays in the release of public funds for farm
credit and COLONE working capital requirements and difficulties in recruiting
project staff have slowed project executioni/.    Settlement, however, has now
begun and the project should be completed in 1978 as envisaged."

(Lns. 1452, 1488, 1525, 1537, 1538, 1557, 1562, 1563, 1568 and 1589), approved

comparison to other settlement projects.      Administrative delays in the
release of public funds for farm credit and COLONE working capital require-
ments and difficulties in recruiting project staff delayed the start of
project execution.   COLONE continues to be hampered by lack of assured fi-
nancing, and this problem is compounded by cost overruns, which presently
amount to 130% over appraisal estimates.  The project must now be considered
to have major financial problems."!/

Sites and Services, Northeast Water Supply and Valesul Aluminum (Lns. 1654,
  1656 and 1660), approved January 23, January 30 and March 6, 1979
"The settlement agency, COLONE, has prepared revised farm development plans
whose credit component, to be financed by public financial institutions, will
be significantly higher than originally estimated, although still low in
comparison to other settlement projects. Administrative delays in the release
of public funds for farm credit, road construction and COLONE working capital
requirements and difficulties in recruiting project staff delayed the start of
project execution.     COLONE continues to be hampered by lack of assured
financing, and this problem is compounded by cost overruns presently amounting
to about 240%."2/

(Lns. 1714, 1720, 1721, 1728, 1729 and 1730), approved May 31 through June 19,
  1979
"The road component of the project now completed was reduced from the original
306 km to 238 km.    The settlement agency, COLONE, has prepared revised farm
development plans whose credit component, to be financed by public financial
institutions, will be significantly higher than originally estimated, although
still low in comparison to other settlement projects.    Administrative delays

(Lns. 1822, 1823, 1824, 1839, 1850, 1867, 1877 and 1895), approved March 27
  through July 22, 1980
"The now completed road component of the project was reduced from the original

expected to complete, having been subject to administrative delays in the
release of public funds, unforeseen legal complications in transferring land
titles to settlers, and cost overruns presently amounting to about 240%. The
Closing Date for this loan has been postponed to December 31, 1980 to allow
the Borrower sufficient time to meet final payments on equipment contracts."

Ceara Rural Dev. II, Electic Power System and Third Urban Transport (Lns.
  1924, 1939 and 1965), approved December 2 and December 23, 1980 and
  March 31, 1981
"The now completed road component of the project was reduced from the original
306 to 238 km.    Other aspects of the project are also nearing completion and
8,000 families have settled in the project area, more than half already
receiving full project services.   However, the project has taken much longer
than expected to complete, having been subject to administrative delays in the
release of public funds, unforeseen legal complications in transferring land
titles from the state to COLONE, the executing agency, and subsequently to
settlers.   However, the first 883 land titles were issued to settlers during
October 1980.     Cost overruns presently amount to about 240% of appraisal
estimate."l/

                    I.   INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW


1.01      During the period 1964-70, mainly in response to severe cyclical
drought conditions in Northeast Brazil, there was a growing Government interest
in assisting emigration from drought areas to regions of higher rainfall in
the pre-Amazon and Amazon. Such settlement began spontaneously as new roads
were opened up, often resulting in the degradation of tropical forest areas.
Also, the shifting cultivation practiced, in the long run, was not appreciably
enhancing the income or standard of living of the immigrants. Faced by the
heavy costs and uneven successes of its early Amazon settlement efforts,
the Government of Brazil was seeking viable long-term solutions to resettlement
problems. The Alto Turi project in the pre-Amazon area of the Northeast state
of Maranhao was to build upon some limited previous settlement efforts in the
area and was intended to be a pilot scheme to test the feasibility of a
low-cost approach to settlement, relying on considerable inputs of voluntary
labor from the settlers for community works. The project was expected to
accommodate 5,200 families, providing basic infrastructure, technical assistance,
health and education services at an average cost per family of about US$2,400.

1.02       The Bank loan of US$6.7 million was approved in 1972. The project
was to be implemented over a period of five years, but protracted start up
problems led to a three-year delay in project completion and were a major
factor in the escalation of total project costs from around US$12.6 million to
US$34.4 million in current prices. Among the major factors (some closely
interrelated) contributing to implementation delays and higher costs were: an
inadequate consensus among Government agencies and between the Government and
the Bank on project design and on the probable viability of the particular
low-cost settlement model proposed (e.g., on recommended production systems;
income targets; credit needs); the resulting need to revise, very early in the
implementation phase, recommendations on farming systems (which initially were
probably too optimistic on the settlers' capacity to self-finance on-farm
investments, and offered too few production options and inadequate income
prospects); irregular and inadequate provision for counterpart financing;
delays and shortages of farm investment (medium term) credit; and legal
difficulties related to land title transfer from Maranhao state to the executing
agency (COLONE). Only after extended negotiation and some revision of the
project design did the project and the executing agency receive reasonably
sustained Government support; project execution was almost all concentrated in
the period beginning in 1976.

1.03      Revised project goals with regard to basic infrastructure (roads,
schools, health posts, hospital and staff housing) were essentially achieved
by end-1980. Some 6,000 settler families (800 above the appraisal estimate)
now live in the two initial project sub-areas (I and II). Of these, some
2,600 are farmers who have benefitted from all aspects of the project and
are operating largely under one of the recommended farm development plans.
Another 1,200 registered farmers in these two sub-areas have received benefits
from most project activities except credit, while the some 2,200 unregistered
farmers in these sub-areas can be assumed to have benefitted partially from
the social and physical infrastructure. In addition to these beneficiaries in
sub-areas I and II, there are some 4,400 registered settlers in the expansion
                                        - 50 -


area (sub-area III) who have not yet substantially benefitted from the project
(except for occasional community development assistance from COLONE).
Production support services, health, education and community development
activities are now operational. However, the transfer of ongoing responsi-
bility for operation and maintenance of these services from the colonization
company (COLONE) to the existing state agencies has been seriously impeded by
the fact that these agencies had little to do with project design and execution
(and remain very weak), and by recurrent cost funding constraints in the state
budget. The economic rate of return, which was estimated to be 16% at appraisal,
is now estimated at about 13% -- the substantially increased costs having been
largely offset by higher than expected crop production and the introduction of
black pepper as a major cash crop. Farmer net cash incomes are now estimated
at well above appraisal estimates.

1.04         Some key lessons emerging from project experiences are that:

       (a)   an agency formed specifically to execute a project needs full
             institutional and political support;

       (b)   project design and concept need both to be subject to a reason-
             able consensus among the parties concerned and also to reasonably
             reflect the mainstream of Government development priorities in
             order to ensure the necessary political and financial support;

       (c) agencies expected to assume and sustain project related services
            after project completion should preferably participate beginning
            from the project design and preparation phase; and

       (d)   the realism of assumptions underlying recommended production
             systems needs to be carefully appraised; and those recommenda-
             tions should be sufficiently flexible to allow adjustments and
             variations to reflect changing conditions during the project
             development period.

1.05      In retrospect, the Bank's appraisal of the project did not adequately
foresee or assess the immediately above-mentioned points. Also, it did not
fully address the need to assure adequate initiation of such environmentally
important measures as reforestation and soil conservation. During supervision,
the Bank probably did not act quickly enough in attaining prompt resolution
of, or understandings on, the various design, funding, organizational and land
titling problems. However, these problems were at least partly rooted in
earlier weaknesses in project preparation and appraisal; once the start up
issues and delays were treated, supervision efforts generally succeeded in
identifying and addressing key new problems as they emerged, in part because
of reasonably good staffing continuity.

                              II.   BACKGROUND


The Agricultural Sector 1/
                                                  2
2.01      With a land area of about 8.5 million km , Brazil had a population
estimated at about 96 million in 1970 which was heavily concentrated in the
South, Southeast and Northeast coastal areas. About half the labor force was
employed in agriculture. In 1971, agriculture contributed about 20% of GDP,
and GDP per capita was US$426, with wide regional variations.

2.02      Since World War II, the growth of agricultural production had
averaged 4% annually but it had been unable to absorb fully the rapidly
increasing rural labor force. This was particularly the case in the Northeast,
where unemployment and rural poverty were prevalant. Bank financing of
Brazilian agricultural projects, as of June 1972, included only one operation
with specific emphasis on agriculture, i.e., the first Livestock Development
Project (Loan 516-BR) in the Center-South of Brazil, with a total project cost
of US$74.7 million and an original loan amount of US$26.0 million. 2/ The
Alto Turi Land Settlement Project was therefore to be the first of its kind
(small-farmer oriented in Northeast Brazil) to receive Bank financing. Of the
25 Bank loans outstanding in Brazil when the Alto Turi Project loan was
signed, the majority were either for electric power projects (48%), roads,
ports and railways (20%), or industry (16%).

The Northeast and Amazon Regions

2.03      The Northeast covers about one-fifth of Brazil.   Climate is
tropical and vegetation ranges from rain forest in the coastal areas to
grassland and scrubland in the semi-arid areas of the interior. These
semi-arid areas comprise about 50% of the region's land area and are subject
to drought. Soils are shallow, sandy and unusually poor in plant nutrients.
Total population in the region was about 28 million in 1970, heavily con-
centrated in the coastal belt (Annex 1, Table 1.1).

2.04      The Northeast is the poorest region of Brazil. Average annual
per capita income in 1970 was about US$200, less than 50% of the national
average, but rural families which relied on their income from itinerant
labor or which lived on subsistence agriculture had annual per capita incomes
of only about US$50 per capita. Agriculture was the most important sector,
accounting for 66% of total employment and 40% of regional GDP. Agricultural
development, however, had been substantially hindered by a poor resource base
and by the lack of research, credit and extension services, and of individual
land titles. Under these circumstances agriculture had been unable to con-
tribute significantly to provide new jobs to meet annual regional increases in
the labor force.

                                    - 52 -


2.05      Government had recognized that, given the limited labor absorption
capacity of industry, much of the solution to the problem of regional unemploy-
ment and poverty would have to lie within agriculture itself. Much of the
focus on agricultural development in Brazil was at the time being given
specifically to development of new lands in the Amazon, which comprises 40% of
Brazil's land area and still had very low population densities. Government
had recently begun to develop the Amazon on a large scale by building roads,
assigning large sums for settlement and agricultural development, creating
new agencies to administer major development programs, and giving fiscal
incentives to attract private enterprise to the area.

Settlement

2.06      During 1965 to 1972, over a million hectares annually were being
added to the agricultural area of the country, and until that period coloniza-
tion had been occurring on lands mainly in the South. With the South rela-
tively well settled, new settlement began occurring mostly in the Amazon, the
Center-West, and adjacent areas of the Northeast bordering Amazonia. In
most of the Amazon areas, under conditions of high rainfall and temperatures
but generally poor soils, it was difficult and expensive to sustain annual
cropping of the land. Families cleared small areas for subsistence foods and
for rice production; when fertility declined they moved on to new areas,
either leaving the land to be developed into extensive pasture by larger-scale
private ranchers or to revert to secondary forest. Shifting cultivation was
beginning to destroy one of Brazil's great natural resources, its tropical
forests; providing only minimal subsistence for the small farmers; and causing
serious social problems arising from the lack of proper housing, health and
education facilities.

2.07      Much of the settlement in the South (and even the Amazon area)
was spontaneous and received little direct Government support. Many of the
Government-sponsored settlement projects which were attempted (particularly
in the Amazon area) have since proven to have been poorly thought out in the
planning stage and then unevenly executed; many participating settlers even-
tually left, or ended up practicing the same type of shifting cultivation
employed by spontaneous settlers. The main propose of the Alto Turi Project
was to help introduce new and simpler methods for officially-sponsored settle-
ment activities, at lower financial costs, which would permit the establishment
of permanent settlement communities in or bordering the Amazon area. The
intended Government policy, during the period, was to eventually re-settle
some 700,000 families into the overall Amazon region between 1970 and 1990,
mainly away from the drought-related socio-economic problems so prevalent in
the Northeast.

The Project Area and the Project Concept 1/

2.08      The project area covers 939,000 ha in the Northwest of the State of
Maranhao, which lies in the transition zone between the Northeast and the
Amazon regions (Maps 1 and 2). Rainfall varies between 2,000 mm in the
 north and 1,500 mm in the south. The temperature is about 27 C all year

     Chapter III.

round. The northern part of the project area is covered by primary forest
and the southern part by secondary forest. Soils are generally of no more
than moderate qualities, shallow and sandy and initially thought to be capable
of sustaining without fertilizer only one crop, followed by permanent pasture
or tree crops, or a 6 to 10 year natural fallow before returning to an annual
crop. The topography is gently undulating. There are numerous permanent
streams, and these, together with shallow wells and boreholes, provide sufficient
water for settlement needs. Drainage is seldom a problem, although in some
areas it limits the choice of crops, and it has created some difficulties for
road construction and maintenance. The project area is well served by the
major trunk roads, such as the paved highway (BR-316) which links the Northeast
(Teresina, Piaui) with the port of Belem near the mouth of the Tocantins
River. This highway also forms the longitudinal axis of the project area.
Other important roads are MA-15 and BR-135 which link the project area and the
city of Sao Luis, capital of Maranhao State. At project appraisal there were
about 110 km of feeder roads in fair condition in a partially settled area,
south of the Turiacu River. River transport had been of relatively minor
importance, and there were no railways. An airstrip, for light aircraft, was
usable during both the wet and dry season. Radio communication was available
but telephone communication was still extremely unreliable.

2.09      The innovative role which this project had for the Bank and
the Brazilian Government was as an experiment in the area of lower cost
land-settlement in pre-Amazonia. As such it was hoped to provide a viable
pattern for future colonization efforts and to provide guidelines which would
serve to limit future social and environmental risk incurred by the high
levels of spontaneous settlement which was proceeding at a very brisk
pace along the periphery of new roads then under construction in the region.
As the Government had such a high settlement target for the overall Amazon and
pre-Amazon region over the 1970 to 1990 period, it was clear that only a
low-cost approach to settlement would be fiscally feasible. The Northeast
Development Superintendency (SUDENE) had, since about 1963 and before initiat-
ing the Bank-financed project, been promoting the idea of settlement in the
Alto Turi area and had indeed already registered and "settled" about 850
families of the some 2,900 families which had spontaneously moved into
the area. The subsequent Alto Turi Project for Bank financing was intended to
be developed over five years by the Companhia de Colonizacao do Nordeste
(COLONE), providing benefits for 5,200 farm families, construction of about
360 km of road, expansion of agricultural research facilities, construc-
tion of about 60 schools and 10 health centers, expansion of an existing
lumber mill, studies on marketing, a survey of water resources, preparation of
future land settlement projects and the establishment of two cooperatives.
Total project cost was estimated at US$12.6 million, of which US$6.7 million
would be financed by the Bank loan, US$5.0 million by the Government financial
participation, and US$0.9 million by settlers' contributions to the project.
The "experimental" nature of the project was destined to play a significant
role in subsequent Government and Bank decisions concerning its viability, and
much needed reformulation during the project implementation (Chapter IV).
Other factors which would prove to have a very pervasive influence upon
implementation of the project were the extremely rapid influx of spontaneous
settlers, following the paving of the main (BR-316) highway in 1973/74, and
unforeseen difficulties surrounding the issue of clear land title to project
lands (paras 3.03 and 4.06).

2.10       The sources of information upon which this PCR is based were,
primarily:   (a) project related documents, reports and correspondence in
LAC files, including supervision reports and studies commissioned by OED; 1/
and (b) data collected by the Project Completion mission. Much of the
latter was compiled by COLONE and a copy of this material is also to be found
in LAC files.


                             III.   FORMULATION


Orgin

 3.01      The origins of officially sponsored settlement in the project area
 go back as far as 1963/64 when SUDENE developed the initial road network and
 settlement nuclei in the area. By 1971, some 18 settlement nuclei and a road
network of approximately 80 km of narrow feeder roads had been built. SUDENE
encountered several problems with the initial settlements, but two were
especially troublesome. These were:    (a) settlers incomes were not appreciably
 increasing based on a slash and burn type of agriculture; and (b) the credit
being given out for crop production each year was not being repaid by the
settlers who were tending to treat credit as grant funding rather than repayable
loans. As the flux of settlers into the area increased with the opening of
the Teresina-Belem Highway (BR-316) the government was seeking, through
SUDENE, a solution to the relative failure of the existing settlement project
and, at the same time, seeking a project model capable of being applicable to
the larger needs of mass emigration from the dry Northeast polygon to Amazonia.
As one of the first steps, the Government requested the British Overseas
Development Ministry (ODM) to make an identification mission to the Alto Turi
region. This mission was done in early 1970. A consultant company was then
requested to evaluate the soils of the project area and recommend crops for
rational use based upon properly identified and evaluated soil fertility
levels. The soil study was provided to SUDENE by October 1970, and it indi-
cated the soils as being largely unsuitable for either rubber or oil palm
cultivation (although subsequent research development has shown the potential
for rubber production in some selected areas to be more promising). SUDENE
then requested the consultants to suggest alternative, viable cropping systems.
The resulting recommendation was for a farm model based upon upland rice
cultivation (one crop only) following initial felling of the forest, to be
followed by undersowing to pasture to provide the basis for small intensive
beef cattle operations, with a total of 30 animals and 36 ha of pasture and a
few (4) hectares for subsistence food and tree crops, plus retaining about 10
ha of forest as a reserve. Under this plan each farmer would effectively
operate on 40 ha of land. The consultants' recommendation became available
roughly at the same time a Bank mission visited SUDENE in response to informal
Government requests for assistance. SUDENE was seeking a viable means of
small-scale settlement which could be translated at a later date into a much
larger, controlled settlement policy for Amazonia, all with a view to reducing
the socio-economic pressures created by the drought problems of the semi-arid
Northeast. At the request of SUDENE and the Government, the consulting firm

     1980, Report No. 2858.
                                   - 55 -
was requested to re-focus the study towards a "feasibility study" of the land
settlement potential of the area with a view to presenting a small model, or
experiment, to the Bank for possible Bank financing. This study was completed
in July 1971, and became the basis for a Bank appraisal mission in November
1971. Meanwhile, it became obvious that two specific Bank positions were not
agreed by the Government, namely that:

     (a)   only a very simple and modest farm model should be
           considered, with minimum credit requirements and with
           maximum voluntary (unpaid) inputs from settlement family
           labor; and

     (b)   the interest rates for the credit component should not
           be subsidized and credit could not be Bank-financed if
           they were.

The differences of opinion remained to adversely affect SUDENE and Government
interest in the project. This was particularly so with reference to the
provision of credit. These early differences of opinion were complicated by
the fact that there was a peculiar dichotomy of objectives between major goals
of various Government agencies involved and the Bank, i.e., reducing losses
from the existing situation (to rescue some postive results from the earlier
land settlement efforts by SUDENE in 1964 to 1971) in the case of the former,
and to creating a basis for an experimental or "model" project in the case of
the latter. 1/ Some of the lessons to be learned from this unfortunate and
conflicting dichotomy of project goals are discussed in Chapter XII. The basic
technical differences in approach to the "farm model" are provided in Annex 2.

Appraisal, Negotiation and Approval

3.02      Appraisal. The Appraisal, carried out during October and November
1971, relied heavily on the feasibility studies prepared by the consultants
under the auspices of the British Overseas Development Ministry, ODM. In
retrospect, it may have relied too heavily on the feasibility study as the
assumptions regarding farm "models" (what could, should or would be produced,
how much that would cost and how it might be financed) would be subject to
differences of opinion among Government agencies and between the Government
and Bank for some time to come. Later, during a May 1973 supervision mission,
the Bank was severely critized by Government for not having adequately addressed
the problems of alternate farm models and for undue emphasis on a low-cost
approach to settlement per se. The feasibility study on which the appraisal
was based was considered by some Government officials to be "useless." Those
officials felt that the Bank mission had not consulted sufficiently with the
various interested Government agencies, including INCRA, the national coloni-
zation and land reform institute and the Central Bank. A full and real
consensus on project objectives and design was probably never reached (either
within the Government or between Government and the Bank), and the result was
something of an uneasy truce between the executing agent (COLONE) and the
other state, regional and federal institutions which had to provide close
cooperation if the project were to have any hope of success, either to retrieve


1/   In fact, the possibility that the project was not specifically designed
     or properly appraised for the stated objectives, but rather was an
     "off-the-shelf" presentation made by Government to the Bank, was raised
     by an Executive Director when the project was considered by the Bank's
     Board.
                                       - 56 -

something from the earlier SUDENE efforts or as an experiment to provide an
acceptable model suitable for repetition on a much larger scale. The lack of
full consensus also resulted in "on-again-off-again" funding for the project
and a longer than expected execution period.

3.03      Negotiations.  Several conditions of loan effectiveness, particularly
concerning the transfer of project lands from the State of Maranhao to the
executing agency, COLONE, and the agreement between these two entities as
to how land titles would be issued to settlers, reflected both Bank and
Government concern that these matters be handled expeditiously. As discussed
further in paragraph 11.01, these matters proved highly problematic in project
execution. The matter of share capital for COLONE, in which the State of
Maranhao, the Bank of the Northeast and INCRA would participate, was also
considered essential to loan effectiveness. A summary of the principal
covenents agreed at negotiation is provided at Annex 3.

3.04      Approval.    The loan (853-BR) was approved on July 6, 1972 and signed
July 24, 1972.

3.05        Project Objectives.   These comprised, as described in the appraisal
report:

     (a)    providing stable employment and satisfactory incomes for
            an estimated 4,500 1/ settler families (mainly in what were
            subsequently referred to as sub-areas I and II) by assisting
            them to develop farms on which they would produce their basic
            food requirements and, in addition, surplus quantities of rice
            and beef cattle for sale as cash income. Such cash incomes were
            expected to increase from Cr$ 1,500 (US$275) 2/ per family to
            Cr$ 2,200 (US$402) 2/ per family at project year 13; and

     (b)    introduction of a number of new concepts and procedures including:
            (i) creation of an autonomous authority to execute the project;

           (ii)   reaching a target income from relatively small operations
                  (40 ha) with a minimum of investment credit;

          (iii)   requiring the settlers to make a substantial contribution
                  of family labor both for farm production and community
                  development;

           (iv)   the issuance of land titles to settlers;

            (v)   creation of credit and marketing cooperatives;

           (vi)   rational use of timber resources after clearance
                  of the forest for settlement and cultivation; and

          (vii)   retention of forest reserves to help protect the environment.

The relative degree to which these various concepts and procedures were
indeed implemented during the project is discussed in Chapter IV.

3.06      Project Indicators. Translated into specific physical goals, the
above objectives were to be achieved through specific targets covering insti-
tution building (i.e., of the executing agency, COLONE, and cooperative,
COMALTA) and through land surveys, plot demarcation, farm development, road
design and construction, agricultural research, extension, supply of cattle,
expansion of the Cocalinho sawmill and studies for rice, beef and lumber
marketing, water supply and for possible future projects. Actual achievement
of these goals based on key indicators are compared with appraisal estimates
in Annex 1, Table 1.2.


                            IV. IMPLEMENTATION


Effectiveness and Start-up Problems

4.01      There was considerable delay in achieving loan effectiveness,
the deadline for which was postponed twice. The recorded reasons for the
delays were associated with:

     (a) legal assurances that the lands of the project area
         had indeed been passed to COLONE by the state; and

     (b) some confusion as to how and whether the loan documents
         were to be registered by the Central Bank.

These issues were finally resolved (or, in the case of (a) thought to be
resolved, para 12.09) and the loan became effective on February 14, 1973,
some five months after loan signing.

4.02      COLONE experienced considerable difficulties in its efforts to
become sufficiently established and to actually commence project execution.
Here the problems were two-fold, but closely interrelated, i.e.:

     (a) lack of working capital (a revolving fund) for COLONE
         operations; and

     (b) lack of farm credit funds to be channeled from the
         Bank of the Northeast (BNB) through COMALTA to the
         settlers as medium-term investment for on-farm development.

In the case of (a) above, a first small advance (Cr$ 3.0 million) from
SUDENE was made to COLONE in early January 1973, but investment credit
did not become available until 1976, in part because of continued disagreements
over production model proposals and credit needs and because of uneven support
of the project concept by various of the Government agencies involved.

4.03      The discussion between the Government and Bank concerning the
desirability of altering the farm model to include black pepper and also raise
the number of cattle to be provided from five to ten seems, in retrospect, to
                                    - 58   -



have been unnecessarily prolonged. In the process, medium-term credit require-
ments in current prices rose from around Cr$ 2,500 (appraisal estimate) to
Cr$ 21,000, which was COLONE's new estimate in 1974. The later position, which
greatly enlarged total project credit requirements while providing for a more
viable farm budget, was agreed to by the Bank in April 1974.

4.04      With these developments and the delay in loan effectiveness, the
project was, by June 1974, essentially 18 months behind schedule. COLONE
had no more than 10% of the required senior staff at that point. Delays,
mostly financial in nature due to a lack of broad political support for the
project, but frequently coupled with a lack of agency coordination at federal,
regional and state levels, caused the project to fall behind schedule a
further six months during the remainder of 1974 and it was not until the
second semester of 1975 that disbursements to infrastructure components began
to reflect a more normal pace of implementation. Thus, despite relatively
good performance during the period of June 1975 to December 1980, the cummu-
lative three-year-delay since start-up could not be overcome and project
completion was three years later than expected (December 1980 instead of
December 1977). Each project component is discussed below with special
reference to factors which influenced implementation and the efficient use of
the services provided.

Physical Infrastructure

4.05      Roads. The objective of the road component was to assist in deve-
loping a system of essential access and feeder roads for year-round transit.
The proposed road component at appraisal comprised construction of some
22 km of penetration roads (US$15,000 equivalent/km); 234 km of access roads
(US$10,000 equivalent/km); 49 km of trails (US$1,000 equivalent/km); and
improvements to some 80 km of existing roads (US$7,000 equivalent/km). 1/
Total baseline cost of the road component, including 10% for supervision, was
estimated at US$3.6 million equivalent, with expected 100% financing by the
Bank. A total of 238 km of penetration and access roads were actually con-
structed under the project. Average cost per km was US$38,025 or almost 280%
higher than appraisal estimates because:

     (a)   an initial three-year delay in construction coincided with
           a period of high inflation and rapidly increasing petroleum and
           construction costs;

     (b)   financial failure of one contractor created a further six-month
           delay; and

     (c)   the standards used were higher than those assumed at project
           appraisal (para 12.08).



1/   By 1975 these 80 km of road had also deteriorated so badly as to require
     full reconstruction and, as a result, were included in a revised total of
     238 km to be constructed under the project.
                                        - 59 -

The remaining net total of 98 km of road, which was designed to be built in
sub-area II to the southwest of BR-316, was dropped when it was found that
settlement could not take place until the boundary lines, to the extreme
southwest of the project area, had been clearly defined in order to avoid
conflict with an Indian reserve adjacent to that section (para 9.02).
Prior to project completion, SUDENE indicated its agreement with COLONE that
an additional 60 km of road, still considered essential to provide an adequate
road network to other areas of controlled settlement in the project area,
would be constructed shortly under federal (POLONORDESTE) funding. Total
road construction costs are shown at Annex 1, Table 1.3.

4.06       Land Settlement. Project goals, at appraisal, called for assisting
2,300 new families and the 2,900 families already living in the project
area, or a total of 5,200 families. As of end-December 1980, it was estimated
that some 6,000 families were living in the initial colonization areas (sub-
areas I and II). Of these, some 2,600 had benefitted from all aspects of
the project and were operating largely under one of the recommended farm
development plans. Another 1,200 registered farmers in these two sub-areas
had received benefits from most project activities except credit, while the
some 2,200 unregistered farmers in these sub-areas can be assumed to have
benefitted partially from the social and physical infrastructure. In addition
to the beneficiaries in sub-areas I and II, there are some 4,400 registered
settlers in the expansion area (sub-area III) who have not yet substantially
benefitted from the project (except for occasional community development
assistance from COLONE). It was also intended that those farmers under
"controlled settlement" (in the event, the 2,600 receiving all services,
including credit) would receive land titles. However, so far only 883 titles
have been issued within 18 settlement nuclei in sub-area I. 1/ The reasons
for this are that COLONE generally wanted to be sure that the farmers were
well established before receiving land titles and, possibly more important,
that only now (1980/81) is COLONE obtaining full undisputed title to project
lands. This is further discussed in paragraph 12.09. With reference to the
political difficulties and uncertainties in providing title on project lands,
both state and federal initiatives have been required to help clear up
a rather complex situation. In more recent years, the problem was further
complicated by debate -- now resolved in COLONE's favor -- as to who, i.e.,
COLONE or the state land agency, COTERMA, should issue certificates of "anuencia"
(in effect, permission to use the land) for settlers cultivating project lands
to which they had no clear title. The distribution of settlement by year and
by project area is shown in Annex 1, Table 1.4.

4.07          The main difficulties encountered in land settlement were associated
with:

        (a)   the large influx of "spontaneous" settlers which followed the paving
              of the Teresina-Belem Highway (BR-316) during 1973/74; and

        (b)   the lack of demarcated lots in areas where road access was still
              lacking.


1/      COLONE records show that this number of land titles were issued in
        October of 1980. However, later more specific data appear to indicate
        that only 707 titles were effectively distributed.
                                    - 60 -
Social Infrastructure

4.08      Schools. Under the project 54 new schools (or 87% of the original
target) were constructed. In addition, repairs were made to 16 existing
wooden units so that 70 units are now available in the project area, or
10 in excess of appraisal estimate. The educational program has exceeded
expectations in the number of participants in the areas of primary and
adult education as well as special programs to provide basic literacy skills
for both previously untrained teenage children and adults. These programs
have been quite successful as evidenced by the fact that more children are now
said to be continuing high school level education in adjacent cities (Sao
Luis and Belem) and the general level of adult education is said to have
also risen. Basic statistics on the current (1980/81) school year program
are shown in Annex 1, Table 1.5.

4.09      Health Services. Fifteen health posts are either completed and
in operation (10) or currently being completed (5 units). This is 50% above
the original target. In addition, sanitary facilities have been constructed
for each family in the 15 nuclei (out of a total of 53 nuclei in sub-areas I
and II) which have also received a health post. In order to gain maximum
utilization of funds designated originally for a new 10-bed hospital, the Noel
Nutels Hospital (already established by SUDENE at the Ze Doca field headquarters)
was enlarged instead into a 35 bed-unit. In addition, a new 30-bed hospital
is being constructed under direct federal funding (though construction was
recently halted for lack of funding). During much of the project execution
period (1973 to 1978), the medical facilities at Ze Doca could only serve
the urgent needs of curative medicine, under rather primitive and crowded
conditions. Commencing in 1978, however, and with the benefit of health posts
and sanitary measures taken in the field, the program of preventative medicine
was able to begin to make a valuable contribution. General health standards,
although still poor in parts of the project area, are said to have improved
significantly. Health service statistics are provided in Annex 1, Table 1.6.

Agricultural Services

4.10      Cooperative and Credit Services. The plan at appraisal called
for the strengthening of the existing cooperative, Cooperativa Mista do
Alto Turi (COMALTA) through the provision of technical and administrative
assistance from the Bank of the Northeast (BNB). Although the technical
assistance staff provided by BNB were basically of a high standard, frequent
changes in staff assigned to COMALTA over the project period (1973 to 1980)
appeared to partly undermine the effort to strengthen the organizational and
administrative capacity of COMALTA to a point which would have: (a) enabled it
to reach a larger number of clients; and (b) stimulated greater participation
of its members to ensure adequate support for increased cooperative activities
and possibly a reduction in the bad-debt burden. In the event, it was COLONE
which supplied consistent staff support, though these COLONE staff were not
well trained in the operation of cooperatives. The end result was that COMALTA
was unable to go much beyond a 2,000 member mark and bad debts, from short-term
production credit mainly for rice, so weakened the cooperative that its
fiscal integrity and the 1979 operating accounts were seriously questioned by
the independent auditors. In August of 1980, COLONE began an administrative
review of COMALTA operations and, early in 1981, several staff changes were
made in order to begin again to strengthen and reorient COMALTA's operations
on a more sound footing.
                                      -   61 -

4.11      It could be argued that the lack of success in strengthening the
cooperative movement in the project area was due at least in part to the lack
of adequate representation by its members. It is also true that untimely
release of short-term crop loans (para 8.10 ) and the general administrative
weakness of the cooperative did not inspire great confidence in the coopera-
tive movement among the settlers. The bad debt ratio, which was usually 25%
or 6 times that estimated at appraisal, was also a decisive factor in weakening
the financial position of COMALTA. 1/ It is obvious, in retrospect, that
bad-debt service could not be adequately covered by the planned 1% spread
above the interest rate being charged to the cooperative (COMALTA). Experience
with farm cooperatives in general in Northeast Brazil appears to confirm that
both short (crop) and medium term (farm investment) credit is probably still
best handled directly by the national commercial banks. In the case of the
project, this solution appeared to be at hand for the 1980/81 crop year when
an "advanced credit post" of the Bank of Brazil (BB) was opened at Ze Doca.
In the first year of this operation, 70% of COMALTA's credit customers chose
to deal directly with this bank. At the same time, however, COMALTA is
interested in becoming more deeply involved in rice and black pepper processing
and in sawmilling. It is not yet at all clear, however, if COMALTA will be
any better equipped to manage these activities more efficiently than it
has handled credit.

4.12      As defined at appraisal, short-term (crop production) loans would
be made annually to finance rice cultivation. Such loans were expected
to average Cr$ 1,050 per farmer per year (in late 1971/early 1972 prices).
In actual fact, and using (1972) constant cruzeiro terms, loans were about 50
to 80% of that figure during the period 1973 to 1978. For the past two crop
years, however, 1979/80 and 1980/81 they have been in excess of the appraisal
estimate by 50 to 75%. This does not reflect, however, a larger (per farmer)
participation in rice cultivation but rather reflects lending for black pepper
harvest, which is now included in the farm model (para 6.01). The number
of short-term loans made each year is now 1,500, or about 65% of the appraisal
estimate.

4.13      Significant on-farm investment or medium-term loans were not made
prior to 1976. During the period 1976 to 1980, a total of 1,808 such loans
were made to settlers, or 40% of the appraisal estimate. The reasons for this
relatively low figure, to date, have been (a) long delays and excessively
complicated administrative procedures in approval of credit plans submitted
through the cooperative and participating banks; and (b) the fact that the
limited total amount of credit available could cover only a smaller number
of the more expensive farm model, which includes black pepper and/or cattle
purchased at prices well above earlier estimates. In constant 1972 terms,
investment loans have averaged Cr$ 5,000 as opposed to the Cr$ 2,480 estimated
at appraisal. Total value of farm investment loans is currently Cr$ 5.8
million (constant 1972 terms) or 70% of appraisal estimate, with only 40% of
the projected number of farmers participating so far. Although shortfalls
in the amount of credit and the frequently untimely release of funds had


1/   There is also   some indication that the early settlers in sub-area I had
     been strongly   influenced by a paternalistic pattern in early SUDENE
     management of   the project, prior to 1972, which may have encouraged the
     recipients to   treat loans as "grant" funds.
                                    - 62 -
a negetative effect, the provision of both crop production and on-farm invest-
ment credit appears to have played a key role in the relative success of the
participating recipients. The timely release of crop production credit was
perceived by project officials as having a direct bearing on annual crop
production levels (chiefly rice). The full actual benefits of on-farm invest-
ment credit (medium-term loans) cannot yet be measured. In the case of black
pepper, production benefits peak in years 3 to 8 of a normal ten-year cycle
and, in the case of beef, full herd development in the project area will
probably not occur much before the end of the century. Nevertheless, the
eventual impact of these credit-facilitated investments is considerable,
in terms of both economic return and the stabilization of long-term settlement
in the area. In sum, both types of credit (short-term and investment) had
crucial roles to play. Data on short and medium credit operations is shown in
Annex 1, Table 1.7.

Technical Assistance Services

4.14      Extension services were being supplied by a total of 45 COLONE
technicians 1/ to some 2,200 settlers in 1980, i.e. 85% of the "controlled"
settlers or 37% of the total families in sub-areas I and II. Coverage for
the 18 nuclei in sub-area I is one agent to a settlement nucleus of 50 farmers,
or total coverage of 900 farmers. Some 13 technicians in sub-area II are able
to attend to a further 1,300 settlement farmers (about 100 farmers/extensionist).
Senior staff in the COLONE agricultural department at Ze Doca provide special-
ized technical advice as crop/livestock subject matter specialists, particu-
larly for crops such as black pepper, pastures and beef cattle (providing
animal health services for the latter). In general, extensionists have
focussed much of their technical attention on the crops new to the area, such
as black pepper, unfortunately foregoing some possible low-cost yield improve-
ments in some of the more mundane basic food crops--maize, rice, cassava and
beans. The specialized new crops, particularly black pepper, have been under-
standably attractive given the favorable economic returns based on a small
unit area (average 0.5 ha). Apart from this criticism of the rather narrow
focus provided by the extension services, the results achieved under rather
difficult circumstances have been commendable.

4.15      Experimental Farm. Project goals included providing quarantine
facilities for purchased beef cattle for subsequent transfer sales through
the project cooperative (COMALTA) to the farmers, and providing improved
pasture seed. These goals later included propagation of black pepper plants
and grafted plants of selected fruit trees. These objectives have all been
basically achieved and the experimental farm area under improved pasture
has expanded from 400 ha to 800 ha. The volume of cattle passing through the
quarantine facility, however, was only 15% of the original estimate mainly
because of severe funding shortfalls for credit and a 100% real increase in
the price of breeding stock. The quarantine facility could not in any case
have accommodated 22,000 head (as compared to the actual 3,225 head) during
the four year period, given what has proven to be the facility's maximum
holding capacity of 1,200 head during the wet season. Although the estimated
time required for inspection and innoculation was not specified at appraisal,


1/   Talks are currently underway on the possibility of transferring these
     technicians gradually to the state extension service (EMATER-MA).
                                   - 63 -
in actual practice the poor physical condition of the animals after transporta-
tion from adjacent states was such that a minimum period of three to four
months in the holding grounds was necessary prior to sale to the settlers.
Hence, even if ample investment loan funds had been made available, only some
14,000 animals or 64% of the appraisal target could have been achieved.

4.16      Research. Adaptive research (i.e., on improved rice varieties,
improved pasture species and alternative crops), though limited, was in
line with appraisal targets in this area. However, more imaginative approaches
to the problem of settler acceptance of new high-yielding varieties of rice
might have led to earlier seed selection of the variety now being promoted
by COLONE. In the area of new crops, the success with black pepper owes a
great deal to COLONE's efforts at adaptation. Overall, however, research
achievements have been very limited and, since there has been a rather poor
relationship with the admittedly still rather weak state research agency, this
has meant that research in the project area still leaves much to be desired.
Rubber, a crop native to the Amazon and previously tested and abandoned in the
early years of settlement in the area (1964 to 1972) is now being reconsidered
(based on more recent research results elsewhere) as a possible tree crop to
be included in the development plans for the proposed "follow-up" project in
COLONE's sub-area III (spontaneous settlement) as part of the Maranhao Rural
Development Project.

4.17       Studies and Surveys. At appraisal it was indicated that studies
on rice, beef and timber marketing; preparation of a second phase of land
 settlement and a survey of the project area water resources would be carried
out as part of the project. Because of the relative ease of marketing rice,
and the minimal amounts of beef produced in a stable "sellers" market locally
where prices were above the national norm, the need for a marketing study for
these two commodities was not considered urgent. However, when it was found
that rice income to the farmer could be improved through greater quality
control over the drying and hulling process, a small rice mill (900 bag/day
capacity) was constructed and placed in operation by COLONE (para 4.20)
just prior to completion of the project, i.e., November/December 1980. Two
studies of timber resources were made as a step toward establishing what
lumber species, and in what quantity, would be available on a sustainable
basis 1/. So far, the main recommendation contained in these two reports
(e.g., more effective utilization of available timber through incentives to the
setters, and improvements in the COLONE lumbering operation) are not yet fully
implemented by COLONE, mainly because of operational difficulties at the
Cocalinho sawmill (para 4.19). In addition, a study on pasture management was
made under the same French technical assistance grant which provided one of
the forest management surveys 2/. Its findings are now integrated into
COLONE's technical assistance operation. As to work on follow-up projects,
COLONE has played a key role in preparation of that part of the proposed
Maranhao Rural Development project to be located in the COLONE area.

sion of logging and milling operations" in order to utilize more fully and
rationally the lumber resulting from forest clearing operations prior to
crop cultivation. Additionally, the Loan Agreement (Schedule 2, Part E)
specifically mentioned the "improvement and expansion of an existing lumber
mill at Cocalinho"; however, withdrawals from the appropriate loan disburse-
ment category (III) were only to be made subject to the condition that a
contract satisfactory to the Bank had been entered into by COLONE for the
management of the mill.

4.19       Based on the above, COLONE entered into a contract with ITALMA,
S.A., of Sao Paulo, Brazil, on January 7, 1974. Some eight months later
 (September 30, 1974) the contract was rescinded at the request of ITALMA
and a penalty of Cr$ 20,000 was paid to COLONE (Bank Supervision Report
of October 31, 1974). During the period November 1974 to December 1979
COLONE continued to operate the sawmill with moderate success and carried
out improvements on its own account, including the major change from a steam
driven engine to an electric motor as the main power source. In December
1979, the Bank, at the request of COLONE, authorized use of part of the
Loan funds (previously allocated for sawmill expansion and improvement) for
logging equipment purchases. This was primarily to restore an appropriate
balance between the logging operation on the one hand and the actual milling
and lumber finishing operation on the other. The required equipment and
machinery was finally purchased and put into operation during June-November
1980. Apart from the important change under which COLONE, rather than a
leasee, operates the mills, the general project goals of promoting more
efficient utilization of felled lumber and of the sawmill's output capacity of
175 m /yr milled lumber per year are on their way to being achieved. Opera-
tion of the mill at full capacity, however, is still hampered by frequent
power failures; also, sawmill net income (in constant cruzeiro terms) is still
only 50% of target.

4.20      Brick Factory; Black Pepper and Rice Mills. None of these three
additional industrial units, currently operated by COLONE, were visualized
at appraisal. They were developed with government funding and have operated,
up to the present time,chiefly as service units for the project; the majority
of bricks have been utilized in the various COLONE construction projects. In
the future, production will largely be for sale. The pepper and rice mills,
with adjacent storage capacity,are used exclusively for rice and black pepper
produced by the settlers. Full operation of the rice mill was to commence
with the 1980/81 crop season, but early indications were that COLONE was having
some difficulty in competing effectively with private intermediaries for the
purchase of rice from farmers.

                 V.   PROCUREMENT, COSTS AND DISBURSEMENT


Procurement

5.01      Procurement was carried out as stipulated in Schedule 1 of the
Project Agreement. For road construction this was by International Competi-
tive Bidding (ICB). No non-Brazilian firms competed. The financial failure
of the low bidder, contracted for the first section of road construction,
suggested some short-comings in the Integrity of the information provided
during the pre-selection process. Procurement for other items in excess of
US$3,000 was under nationally advertised bidding procedures, and worked quite
well. This group of items was composed mostly of vehicles and machinery, and
local distributors were, in most cases, the only interested participants. Due
to the relative remoteness of the project area, reliable after-sales-service
was a key factor in bid evaluations.

Project Costs

5.02      Based on current cruzeiro figures and yearly average exchange rates
the total project cost to December 31, 1981 was Cr$ 804.5 million (US$34.4 mil-
lion) as compared to Cr$ 69.5 million (US$12.6 million including contingencies)
for the comparable items as estimated at appraisal. The 173% cost overrun in
US dollar terms may be attributed principally to factors of rapidly spiralling
construction costs, particularly for roads (following petroleum price increases),
agreed changes in road design standards, and delays in project implementation
which took place over an eight-year period, or three years longer than estimated.
The actual project costs are shown in Annex 1, Table 1.8. The average cost per
family was about US$5,700 equivalent (considering only the registered and
unregistered farmers living in sub-areas I and II), as compared to US$2,400
per family estimated at appraisal. As noted in paragraphs 7.01 and 7.02, the
project cost increases were fortunately at least partly offset by higher
than expected production earnings. Also, though the costs per family
are still reasonably low in light of the incomes being generated among
participants, or when compared to some other settlement projects (e.g.,
the Government's earlier Amazon settlements), the significant increase
does reflect the weaknesses (mentioned elsewhere in the report) in various
of the technical, financial, political and social facets of the original
project design.

Disbursement and Financing

5.03      Allocation of the proceeds of the Bank loan is shown in Annex 1,
Table 1.9, and the actual cumulative disbursement schedule is given in
Annex 1, Table 1.10. The actual profile of disbursement is fairly similar in
shape to the appraisal estimate and also the Bank generated profile for
all agricultural and rural development projects, but has the predominent
feature of significant start-up delays (Chart 1). The Bank loan only financed
about 20% of project costs, as compared to the 53% Bank participation estimated
at appraisal. The Brazilian Government participation for credit, both short-
term and long-term, while still inadequate for total requirements, was actually
Cr$ 17.3 million (constant terms) as opposed to Cr$ 17.0 estimated at appraisal.
                                     - 66 -

Total short-term (crop) credit was 75% above estimate, while medium-term
(on-farm investment) credit was 26% below estimate. The delays and shortfalls
in counterpart funding and credit reflected, at least in part (and as noted
elsewhere in this report), lack of a political consensus regarding the design
and priority of the project.


                          VI.     DEVELOPMENT IMPACT


Agricultural Production

6.01      The revised farm models introduced black pepper as a new cash crop
in the rice/beef cattle model. In addition, such basic food crops as maize,
cassava and beans became an important source of income, particularly for the
"rice only model and in part because the farmers having the higher income
crop/livestock model tended to purchase the basic food items and concentrate
on black pepper and cattle production with restricted rice or other food crop
cultivation. The estimated areas of production and total yields for project
year eight (1979/80 crop year) were as follows:

 Commodity                      Area Cultivated        Total Production
                                     (ha)                (metric tons)

Rice                                 14,262                 16,262

Black Pepper                            304                    825

Maize                                (5,171)                 2,171

Cassava (as farinha)                 (7,705)                11,556

Beans                                (4,500)                 2,520

Pasture (ha),                         5,210
Beef as Carcass Weight (mt)                                    149

                                     19,776


It should be noted that, as the basic food crops (maize, cassava and beans)
are intercropped with rice, the total area under cultivation is approximately
20,000 ha. Gross benefits from the marketing of these commodities amounted to
Cr$ 241 million or US$4.6 million in 1980. Projected maximum production from
the beef herd, assuming no further purchases of animals, would not be reached
until project year 20 or 1993 as opposed to year 16 estimated during
appraisal. Black pepper, under current plans to plant no more than 600 ha,
will reach peak returns in project year 13 (1985), if one were to assume no
replacement of older plantings as they reach maturity (Annex 1, Table 1.11).
                                     - 67 -

Employment

6.02      It is estimated that the project has so far generated the equivalent
of about 6,150 jobs. At least 90% of the work requirement generated involves
family labor employed on the family farm. However, the demand for labor on
other farm properties and in the much enlarged Ze Doca township probably
contributes at least 10% to work force requirements.

Farm Income 1/

6.03      By 1980, or project year eight, net cash income per family (cal-
culated in a manner comparable to that used at appraisal, and which did not
count home consumption of subsistence crops) was estimated to be in the range
of Cr$ 5,500 to 5,900 in 1972 cruzeiros (US$926 to 994) 2/ for the rice only
model. This compares favorably with the income of Cr$ 1,450 (US$244) forecast
at appraisal. The new model having both livestock and black pepper, but with
decreasing emphasis on rice and basic food crops, was showing (in 1972 Cr$)
net cash income in the range of Cr$ 6,400 to 7,200 (US$1,080 to 1,200), though
this is still likely to improve considerably given the late acquisition of
cattle and black pepper due to limited availability of medium-term investment
loan funds. This income range is also more than double the estimate
(Cr$ 3,000) for the beef-rice model forecast at appraisal. A typical farm
budget for the two farm models is shown at Annex 1, Table 1.15. Unless
improved inputs (i.e., higher yielding varieties, appropriate fertilizer and
plant protection methods) are introduced, 3/ the "rice only" farm model would
not keep pace with the beef cattle/black pepper model which, by 1985, would
generate an income almost three times the "rice only" system. It should be
noted that increased farm incomes were derived mainly from the increased land
area under production and the inclusion of various food crops. With the
exception of beef prices which doubled in value in real terms, and rice prices
which increased slightly, real prices for other crops did not change signifi-
cantly (Chart 2).

Equity

6.04      Benefits were as expected predominantly accrued by small farmers.
Actual (1980) cash income per family of US$900 to 1,200 in constant (1972)
dollars, compares very favorably with appraisal estimates of US$454 (1972
US$) for settler incomes in project year nine. The spontaneous settlements
surrounding project settlement nuclei, and in sub-area III (to be consolidated
under the proposed Maranhao Rural Development Project) still include some
farmers claiming "squatters rights" on properties in excess of 2,000 ha.
However, these do not directly threaten the development of project farms.
Also, most are smaller; and COLONE is proposing that, in exchange for access
to better infrastructure and services (i.e., feeder roads, technical assistance,


1/   Calculations for average farm incomes were based on a 20% field survey
     sample of the number of farmers for each of the two farm models.

2/   1972 US dollars calculated at the prevailing exchange rate of
     Cr$ 5.934 = US$1.00.

3/   Various such possibilities are being explored for the proposed Maranhao
     Rural Development (follow-up) Project.
                                   - 68 -
credit services and improved health and education facilities), the occupiers
of larger areas agree to reduce their claims. The legal difficulties surrounding
this issue are, however, complex and efforts to satisfactorily resolve them
are a key part in the preparation of the proposed follow-up project.

Foreign Exchange Effects

6.05      At appraisal, foreign exchange earnings were not projected to
be significant. The higher (33%) than expected increase of rice production
has made an important contribution to the stabilization of local markets
for this staple food crop. Brazil, nationally, fluctuates between being a net
exporter and net importer of this crop. Beef production, on the other hand,
is only 2% of appraisal estimates and has certainly not yet contributed
significantly to supply within the state of Maranhao or the region, and
certainly not to exports. Brazil, however, is a net exporter of black pepper,
so the project has unexpectedly made an important contribution there. Esti-
mates are that the project area will be producing 10% (3,200 tons) of the
total national production of black pepper by 1985.

Transfer Effects

6.06      Negative changes to non-participating farms appear to have been
negligible. Indeed, "non-participating" farms in the project area have
benefited considerably in the following areas: (a) basic infrastructure
(specifically, penetration and access roads) and resulting improved access
to markets; (b) education; and (c) health and community development programs.
The only two areas where they have not enjoyed specific benefits, equal
to those of project participants in controlled settlement nuclei, have been:
(a) crop and investment credit; 1/ and (b) an intensive level of technical
assistance services.

Secondary Goals and Unexpected Effects

6.07      The experience and the data-base studies of the Alto Turi project
are making a considerable contribution to design and preparation of the
proposed follow up Maranhao Rural Development project; in this respect,
the "lessons learned" on what not to do may be more important than the
provision of a proven methodology worth repetition. Major lessons learned
are detailed in Chapter XII. The goals of establishing stable farming systems,
as opposed to migratory shifting cultivation, were largely achieved. The
introduction of improved pastures and the introduction of.a permanent cash
crop (black pepper) made significant contributions in this area. The stable
community, based on the small town of Ze Doca at the southeastern end of the
project area, was a reality before project initiation in 1973; however, at
least in part as a result of the project, the community has prospered and has
been greatly enlarged with commerce flowing from the project area to local and
regional markets. Rural industries, based on lumber, bricks, crop drying and
cleaning (rice and black pepper), have all contributed to the general growth of
the Ze Doca economy. The project cooperative (COMALTA) is now anxious to add
the manufacture of "farinha" or cassava meal to this list of its agro-industrial
activities.


1/   For the 1980/81 crop year, production credit from an advance post of the
     Bank of Brazil (BB) would become available to "spontaneous" settlers also.
                                    - 69 -
Overall Assessment

6.08      A major project goal stated at appraisal was to provide a model for
low-cost settlement in part through the significant contribution of voluntary
family labor to self-help projects such as road maintenance, building of
schools and health posts. This community organization and "self-help" concept
was not successfully achieved in the main project area of controlled settlement,
in part because the newly formed executing agency (COLONE) had no previous
experience in community development efforts. Interestingly enough, however,
these "self-help" concepts have emerged in areas of spontaneous settlement
(sub-area III), reflecting probably both the absence of a history of a pater-
nalistic Government presence in that area as well as COLONE's gradually
growing expertise in selective community development interventions. Another
possible explanation is that since COLONE had no resources available for the
settlers in sub-area III (which was not programmed for development under the
first project), it was forced to develop a new approach to assistance for
those settlers. Thus, COLONE provided an umbrella of legitimacy for the
settlers and helped them to organize the community largely as a means of
protecting their land from threatened invasion, and also, at a later stage, of
securing the necessary basic services.

6.09      Other shortcomings in the project, which are probably not too
surprising in an experimental project of this type, related to the adequacy
of arrangements planned to deal with land tenure problems and spontaneous
settlement, and the lack of consistently strong political support for the
project at the state and federal level. In the event, these issues severely
compromised the pilot concept from the beginning and the executing agency
became, of necessity, unduly involved in ensuring the fiscal integrity
both of the project and of COLONE itself as an institution. What is probably
most rewarding is that, despite the legal, financial and political uncertain-
ties involved, the project goals of strengthening infrastructure, social and
economic welfare in the project area seem to have been achieved to a signif-
icant degree.


                          VII.   RATE OF RETURN


Economic Rate of Return

7.01      In calculating the economic rate of return of the project, the
actual investment and operating costs and project benefits were adjusted
to 1972 prices. The estimated cost and benefit flows are indicated at Annex 1,
Table 1.11. The methodology was as described in Annex 15 of the appraisal
report with the necessary adjustments to reflect:  (a) the addition of black
pepper in the rice/cattle farm model; and (b) the fact that COLONE continued
to operate the sawmill after lease agreements were rescinded on August 30,
1974. The "without project" situation assumed, as at appraisal, an initially
constant (then gradually declining) total production of rice. This would
reflect shifting production on a gradually larger area (enabled by the improve-
ments to the BR-316 highway), but with gradually lower yields and without the
benefit of services and greater road penetration off the main highway. Crop
and livestock production data, including prices of inputs and outputs were
                                   - 70 -

based on actual data for the period 1976 to 1980. Except for beef (for which
the real price increased considerably) and rice (for which there was a slight
price increase), other commodities produced did not experience significant
changes in real price levels. Data previous to 1976 are incomplete and
therefore must be considered as less reliable estimates. Future production of
crops has been conservatively estimated to decline after 1984, reflecting both
the need for new investments or efforts (whose costs have not been included)
to improve yields or cropping prospects and the gradual likely shift to
greater dependence on income from animal production. Data on project implemen-
tation and investment costs was supplied by COLONE, but BNB administrative
costs were an estimate based on actual staff participation.

7.02      The revised estimate on the internal economic rate of return is 13%,
as compared to 16% at appraisal. The revised rate of return estimate assumed,
as had been assumed at appraisal, a zero opportunity cost of labor. If, however,
the opportunity cost of labor were assumed to be 50% of the current wage rate
in the project area, then the revised economic rate of return would be about
10%. Overall, the incremental project costs appear to have been in large part
offset by higher than forecast crop earnings (especially with the introduction
of black pepper) even though earnings from livestock development have been
much delayed. Had this livestock component physically developed as forecast
at appraisal, returns would have further helped to offset the affects of
overall project price increases.

7.03.     As to the fiscal impact of the project, it is estimated that recurring
project-related expenditures (excluding credit, but including such things as
maintenance of extension and research services, roads, education and health
services, some COLONE administrative costs, etc.) will be amounting to roughly
US$1.2 million annually. Based on data on actual tax collections over the
past several years (mainly the ICM tax on marketed produce) and projected
production figures, it is estimated that the project will be yielding around
US$0.7 million annually in tax revenues. This would be equivalent to just
under 60% of recurring project-related costs. As to the recovery of rural
credit, the current unindexed interest rates (Annex 1, Table 1.7) are extremely
low in comparison to recent annual inflation of over 100% in Brazil; as a
result, the real share of credit funds recovered is very low (as with other
rural credit in Brazil).


                   VIII.   INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE


COLONE

8.01      The executing agency for the project, Companhia de Colonizacao
do Nordeste, was created specifically for the project, but with a view to its
eventually carrying out other similar colonization and rural development
projects in the Northeast. It was officially formed on May 19, 1972, and was
registered by the State on July 12, 1972. As executing agent for the project,
COLONE had the major responsibility for all phases of project implementation.
                                    - 71 -
COLONE was also the main contact point for Bank supervision missions. COLONE
is a public company whose shares are distributed between the Superintendencia
do Desenvolvimento do Nordeste (SUDENE) with 51%, the major stockholder; the
State of Maranhao (48%); and the President-Director of COLONE (1%). At
appraisal, it was proposed that the Instituto de Colonizacao e Reforma Agraria
(INCRA) and the Bank of the Northeast (BNB) also become minority stockholders.
INCRA declined to participate; also, it was later realized that, as BNB was
to have business dealings with the project cooperative (COMALTA) to which
it supplied credit, it could not participate in share ownership of COLONE.

8.02       COLONE's administrative board comprises five members appointed by
SUDENE and the sixth member is COLONE's President. As the latter also has
the "tie-breaking" vote, he exercises unusual powers. COLONE's day-to-day
operations are the responsibility of a three-member Board of Directors,
i.e., COLONE's President and the Directors for Technical and Administrative-
Financial Operations. COLONE operates from its headquarters in Sao Luis,
where approximately 13% of the staff are located. Of these, some 46% are
professional staff. 1/ Field operations are implemented from the project
field station Ze Doca, where the remaining staff (87%) are located. Admin-
istration at this field station is the responsibility of the Project Coordinator
with field operations divided into five operational departments as follows:
Agriculture; Infrastructure; Community Development; Industrial Units; and
Administration. COLONE's current organization is shown in Chart 3. COLONE's
role was originally intended to be one of implementation of the project until
key components (i.e., infrastructure, settlement, community development,
cooperative organization and health, education, agricultural research and
extension services) had all been successfully placed in operation. COLONE
would then divest itself of these service operations to the appropriate state
authorities involved. The limited success achieved in this area is described
in paragraphs 8.06 to 8.08, 8.13 and 8.14.

8.03      Despite considerable growth of staffing during the project execution
period (1973 to 1980) -- from 15 in 1973 to 542 in 1980 (Annex 1, Table 1.12)
-- COLONE was never on a sufficiently secure financial footing to be considered
a well-established and functioning institution. Even the special assistance of
the business consultant firm (Arthur Anderson) could not be fully absorbed by
COLONE although some significant administrative recommendations were imple-
mented. The continued precarious financial support to the institution, at
least up until mid-1977 when POLONORDESTE funding became available to COLONE
for the first time, created a situation in which COLONE could not be consist-
ently competitive in the job market; nor could it acquire adequate office
space for maximum operating efficiency. This was particularly the case at the
Sao Luis office. The important institutional objectives for COLONE as part of
the project were to develop:  (a) strong administrative capability and tech-
niques to be applied to land settlement in the Northeast (Pre-Amazonia); and
(b) effective planning and cost management of such projects. In the project
area the accomplishments of COLONE staff in the community development, health,
education and agricultural extension areas have been relatively good, particu-
larly when viewed in light of the slow implementation of the necessary infra-
structure and lack of continuous political support.


1/   At appraisal it was indicated that COLONE headquarters would be located
     at Ze Doca. Because of communication difficulties and the lack of
     infrastructure this did not prove viable.
                                      - 72 -
8.04      The objective of creating permanently improved staff capability
was only moderately successful, despite an active training program throughout
the project cycle (Annex 1, Table 1.13). Personnel policies within COLONE
have been generally commendable in the sense of retaining key personnel
despite delays in the payment of salaries and frequent frustrations due to
curtailment of annual work programs previously approved but lacking funding
when actual implementation should have occurred. Cost accounting, although
generally improved along the lines of the recommendations of the consultants,
had later to be refined at the recommendation of the auditors. Also, its
usefulness for assessing project activities is somewhat limited in that the
new system is not really consistent with original presentations of the various
cost categories used at appraisal. In retrospect, it can also be said that
the project should have had better baseline studies for monitoring and evalua-
tion purposes. This is particularly true for evaluation of the farm develop-
ment models.

8.05      As to its future, COLONE would probably not survive a project
phase-out, if it were not for its planned significant role in the proposed
Maranhao Rural Development project. It is probable, however, that COLONE's
role in that project will be to coordinate that portion of the project dealing
with the expansion or consolidation of settlement activities in sub-area III
(Maranhaozinho) of the project area with actual responsibility for execution
shared with the various state agencies. In addition, COLONE has some limited
revenue generating capacity based mainly on its industrial division (sawmill,
brick factory, black pepper and rice processing mills). In general, however,
COLONE's role as an executing agency for colonization projects elsewhere in
the Northeast is still uncertain. Other specific projects are not clearly
identified. Nevertheless, the public image of the agency is relatively good
and its linkages to other agencies (SUDENE, INCRA, FUNAI, FSESP, EMATER,
EMAPA, etc.) have at least improved during the 1976 to 1980 period. Such
distrust as still exists in some cases would appear to lie mainly in the fact
that COLONE, in its current activities, infringes on at least part of the
broad mandate of the institutions mentioned and, despite financial constraints,
has shown a capacity to execute land settlement and rural development to a
highly commendable degree when compared with what other institutions, with
full political support, have been able to accomplish in the general region.
This reflects the very considerable energy, dedication and persistence shown
by the COLONE administration.

Departamento de Estradas de Rodagem (DER-MA)

8.06      The state road construction and maintenance agency was expected to
take over the maintenance of project roads one year after road construction
completion. Contacts by COLONE with DER-MA management to discuss the matter,
beginning even before road construction was completed have, however, been
quite unsuccessful. The state administration recognizes that the DER-MA must
accept responsibility for road maintenance in the project area, but is not yet
able or prepared to provide the necessary funding. The state government has
provisionally agreed that DER-MA accept responsibility for executing road
maintenance functions starting with 1982, but provided that COLONE help assure
the necessary funding. COLONE's attitude has been that under such arrangements
(i.e., COLONE having to find the necessary funding), they might just as well
provide maintenance themselves by having these funds directly administered by
their Infrastructure Division at Ze Doca.

Empresa Maranhense de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMAPA)

8.07      It was also intended at appraisal that EMAPA (in 1972 it had the
name IPEAN) would gradually assume the agricultural research functions and
programs related to the project and initiated by COLONE. In November 1977,
COLONE entered into a two-year provisional contract arrangement for the period
1978/79. The contract covered all required agricultural research programs
under the project, with the exception of pasture research, which was considered
essentially complete. The contract was not renewed at the end of the 1979/80
crop year, as new aministrative personnel at the Bacabal (EMAPA) station and
at COLONE's Ze Doca field station differed as to how (technically) the black
pepper research should be carried out. Also, EMAPA has suffered a lack of
state counterpart funding to provide sufficient staff and transportation
facilities in order to adequately maintain experiments in the project area,
while COLONE has, perhaps justifiably, been extremely reluctant to give up its
research staffing and control until a substitute arrangement is firmly and
reliably in place.

Empresa de Assistencia Tecnica e Extensao Rural (EMATER-MA)

8.08      The State Agricultural Technical Assistance and Rural Extension
Agency, EMATER-MA, was expected to be assuming extension responsibilities soon
after project implementation was complete. In the event, this also has proven
difficult to arrange, primarily because the state was not able to make avail-
able the necessary additional funds to EMATER. Also, the technical assistance
being provided by COLONE is more intensive than EMATER-MA typically provides,
and the technicians live in the settlement nuclei. At least one crop (black
pepper) is highly specialized and for that reason receives a higher level of
technical assistance inputs. These latter factors have also delayed transfer
of responsibility to EMATER.

Cooperativa Mista do Alto Turi (COMALTA)

8.09      The project cooperative at Ze Doca, with a field agency at Nova
Linda operating only during the two most recent crop years, has operated under
procedures close to those visualized at appraisal, i.e., they have channeled
credit from the Bank of the Northeast (BNB) to the settlers. Membership of
the cooperative had been a mandatory pre-condition for receiving such credit.
(In retrospect, it now seems unfortunate that the cooperative was used to pass
on credit since this function could probably have been better performed by
existing banks suitably strengthened to operate in the project area.) From a
management point of view, the credit function of the cooperative is still very
weak, and relies heavily on personnel and technical assistance from BNB. Even
this arrangement has not been ideal since BNB personnel tend to refuse any
type of permanent assignment to COMALTA and turnover is high, e.g., three
changes of accounting staff within the past year.  Currently, an indepth study
of COMALTA's operating procedures, including a complete audit of accounts, is
being carried out by an auditor (from Fortaleza) under contract to COLONE.
This course of action was taken following the report of the independent
auditor (Bouchinas, Campos and Claro S/C Ltda.), which indicated that the
state of COMALTA accounts were such they could not provide an opinion based
upon the audit made (August 22, 1980). It is interesting to note that,
                                     - 74 -
mirroring doubts expressed by Executive Directors of the Bank during the
discussion on the proposed Alto Turi Loan, the cooperative's functioning
depended excessively on outside technical assistance, and in general the
results have not been good.

Bank of the Northeast of Brazil (BNB)

8.10      As has been noted in paragraph 8.09, BNB was unable to accept the
degree of heavy responsibility for management of cooperatives implied in
credit arrangements visualized at appraisal. However, BNB did provide inter-
mittent technical assistance to COMALTA. This, in the event, proved inadequate
to the task of enabling COMALTA to become a strong enough entity, both finan-
cially and administratively, to meet the increased demands of the full comple-
ment of settlers in the area. BNB did, however, channel both the short-term
(crop production) and medium term (farm investment) funds through COMALTA to
the settlers. The major complaints concerning this operation were the lack of
timely release of short-term loan funds and the inadequacy of the amount
of medium-term loan funds made available. In retrospect, the latter should
have not been a surprise since, at appraisal, it was noted that BNB appeared
to lack sufficient resources for long term financing. This was further
exacerbated by the fact that interest rates on official credit (though
recently increased) were held by the Government at very low levels, with
inflation rapidly increasing, during the project period. Real recoveries have
therefore diminished substantially and sharp restrictions on new credit
availability have made investment credit extremely scarce.

Superintendencia de Desenvolvimento do Nordeste (SUDENE)

8.11      Following the acute physical hardship and social dislocation expe-
rienced by the rural population of the Northeast in the especially serious
1958 drought, the Government set up SUDENE in December 1959, with a mandate to
promote, supervise and coordinate new development projects either directly or
by means of agreement or contracts with other agencies. The relationship of
SUDENE to COLONE was more than contractual in that SUDENE was the major
stockholder in COLONE, had the majority vote on its Board of Directors and
would also have responsibility for channeling federal funds, from the Ministry
of the Interior to COLONE, to cover the administrative expenses of COLONE and
fund project investments. After the establishment (in 1973) of a revolving
fund with Cr$ 3.0 million, SUDENE was subsequently unable to either maintain
the revolving fund balance or to meet COLONE's funding requests based on
SUDENE-approved annual operating plans. Increasingly, during the years 1975
to 1978, COLONE sought financial assistance directly from Federal authorities
in Brasilia. These actions doubtless resulted in a weakening of the COLONE/
SUDENE relationship which had never been strong. It was not until 1977 that,
with the allocation of POLONORDESTE program funds to the project through
SUDENE, the linkage of COLONE to SUDENE was reinforced. Although it is not
quite clear why SUDENE was not more supportive of the fledgling COLONE
during the formative years (1973 to 1975), one clue may be that some in
SUDENE sought a larger role in coordinating project implementation and grew to
resent the fact that both COLONE and the Bank tended initially to consult with
SUDENE only to obtain funding for the project (para 11.03), but not on tech-
nical matters. SUDENE's current rather supportive attitude towards COLONE
and the Alto Turi project are probably stronger than at any time during the
eight-year implementation period.
                                     - 75 -

Instituto Nacional de Colonizacao e Reforma Agraria (INCRA)

8.12      The role of this institution in project implementation was, from the
beginning, much less than assumed at project appraisal and stemmed partly from
its not fully supporting the project design or concept and, hence, disinterest
in becoming a shareholder in COLONE. During the period 1972 to 1975, INCRA
was still very much involved with the establishment of settlement along the
Transamazon highway and the settlement model (particularly the farm model) to
be tested in Maranhao by COLONE was somewhat different from the Transamazon
settlement program model (in which, for example, both project investment costs
and farm incomes were planned to be much higher). Despite these early differ-
ences, the regional INCRA office in Maranhao has in recent years shown an
interest in the Alto Turi experiment. Also, COLONE has assisted in the
establishment of backyard citrus plots for settlers in other (INCRA directed)
settlements within Maranhao.

Fundacao Servicos Especiais de Saude Publica (FSESP)

8.13      It was intended, at appraisal, that SUDENE would finance the health
services during the first ten years of project life and that, thereafter, such
costs would be borne by the Maranhao State Government. In practice, SUDENE
has supplied funding to COLONE for operation of the Noel Nutels Hospital
in Ze Doca. However, starting in 1979, the State Secretariat of Health has
contributed to the annual budget of this hospital by providing medicines and
one doctor. On March 12, 1979, COLONE signed a contract with FSESP for the
staffing of all project health posts as soon as they became operational.
FSESP is also financing the construction of a 30 bed hospital for the project
area. Construction of that hospital, now temporarily halted due to funding
shortages, had been expected to be completed by the end of 1981; FSESP will
staff and operate that facility.

Secretaria de Educacao do Estado do Maranhao (SEC-MA)

8.14      As for health services, noted above, the plan at appraisal was for
SUDENE to fund expenditures for the project area schools until year 10 of the
project, after which such services would be funded through the state education
secretariat (SEC-MA). Up to the present time, funds have been channeled to
COLONE through SUDENE and, since mid-1977, they have mainly comprised
POLONORDESTE funding (99%) with slightly less than 1% coming from the MOBRAL
(Federal program resources) specially applied to adult education programs.
Progress in transferring all these educational services to the state authority
is somewhat similar to the position on road maintenance (i.e., the State
Secretariat for Education, SEC-MA, is understandably unwilling to accept
responsibility unless incremental funding for teachers' salaries, etc., is
included in their budget). An added problem, as in the case of agricultural
extension, is that the intensity of services currently being provided by COLONE
is higher than those being offered in the general project area municipalities.
Discussions with SEC-MA are continuing, but the problems are not expected to be
resolved before 1982.

                          IX. SPECIAL ISSUES


9.01      Sector and Political Influences. Particularly during the early
years of project implementation, i.e., 1973 to 1975, it was evident that the
project was not in total conformity with existing key federal plans and
priorities. Indeed, during that period, efforts were being made to promote
settlement, on a much larger scale, along the newly built Transamazon highway
and the Alto Turi "lower cost" approach, though of interest to many in the
Government, got little more than token attention overall. After the change of
administrations, at both state and federal levels, and increased evidence of
serious problems in the Transamazon settlements, the project gradually received
more attention and support.

9.02      Contacts with Indian Tribes. It is perhaps worthy of note that,
during the discussion by the Bank's Board of Directors on the proposed loan,
a question was raised concerning the possible presence of Indian tribes
in the area. Based on the knowledge then available to the Bank staff, a
reply was given that there were no Indians in the project area. As project
property lines were understood at that juncture, the statement was accurate.
However, the presence of a settlement of the Urubu-Kaapor tribe was confirmed
when project implementation began (1973). There were 262 Indians living along
the southern edge of the project area at that time. Later (1976/77), the
Indian tribe and their FUNAI agent in Sao Luis reported that COLONE road
survey engineers, in project sub-area II, were trespassing on their lands.
Meetings between FUNAI and COLONE were held and agreement was reached to
re-survey the southwest boundary of the property area. The survey
(Map 3) recognized the Indian claim on a pie-shaped strip of land in the
extreme southeastern quadrant of the property. As a result, all engineering
and subsequent settlement in the section was halted. The Indians now have
access to COLONE-provided health services on request; COLONE and FUNAI
have also developed a constructive relationship to help ensure protection
of the tribe from settler incursions into Indian lands.

9.03      Land Development Strategy. In terms of land development strategy,
the project experience allows some useful observations, though not necessarily
any clear cut answers. Firstly, it would seem in retrospect that insufficient
attention was given to the need to match land use to land capability. The
problems here fell into two types: the basic resource surveys seem to have
been insufficiently comprehensive and were not followed up with further
detailed studies during implementation; and COLONE seemed unable to ensure
that actual land use complied with the recommendations arising out of the
studies that were carried out. It should be recognized that the spontaneous
settlement presented a particular problem for COLONE since this took place
outside the areas intended for settlement during the initial phase and,
hence, in areas which were inadequately surveyed from a land use standpoint.
One lesson to be learned is that if the necessary land use potential surveys
have not been fully completed at the time the project starts, they should
nonetheless still be carried out during the execution phase. Further, if
spontaneous settlement has occured in areas which are subsequently considered
unsuitable for development, systematic attempts should be made either to
relocate physically the settlers to suitable areas or to require that they
adopt certain practices consistent with the land use potential of the area
settled. As noted in paragraph 4.06, the latter can be linked to the timing
of titling.
                                      - 77 -
9.04      A second general observation of relevance for future projects of this
type concerns the choice of agricultural development strategy. The choice here
is whether to aim for a high cost, high input, high output approach which, with
limited funds, can reach only a lower number of settlers, or for a low
cost, low input, low output approach which could serve more beneficiaries
with the same available funds.  (Obviously there are any number of intermediate
choices also available.) While the latter approach appears preferable, it
is important that the "technological package" offers a return which provides
sufficient incentive for its widespread adoption. It is also clearly essential
that a thoroughly tested low input technological package really does exist.
In the case of the Alto Turi project, it appears that a fully appropriate low
input package probably did not exist. Further, the executing agency eventually
chose (understandably given that this was its first attempt and one on which
it would be judged) to take an approach which minimized the risks of "failure"
by tending to concentrate its resources on a relatively low number of settlers
and encouraging adoption of a moderately high input-high output technology
(i.e., pepper and beef cattle).

9.05      Environmental Impact. The project appraisal report stated that
"the project would demonstrate a means of preserving a balance between
developing new land and retaining the ameliorative effects of forest areas
and pastures." However, as the primary forest in sub-areas I and II had been
severely depleted before the project was effectively initiated, it is dif-
ficult to determine how the project, as designed, could have been reasonably
expected to demonstrate these effects in those areas. The project did not
apparently foresee the need to foster reforestation efforts. In the large
section (sub-area III) of project lands which is still thought to be mainly in
primary forest and where most of the spontaneous settlement has taken place,
COLONE is now finding it necessary to call for the assistance of guards
supplied by the Instituto Brasileira de Desenvolvimento Forestal (IBDF) to
assist in controlling the indiscriminate felling and burning of virgin forest
lands. 1/ It is also considering, in the proposed Maranhao Rural Development
Project, incorporation of stronger safeguards to protect forest reserves in
the area as well as reforestation and conservation programs to help prevent
serious environmental degradation.

9.06      In general, the effects of planting pasture on 5,210 ha of pre-
viously cultivated (rice) lands in sub-areas I and II of the project can
be said to have helped ameliorate soil erosion. The area has now reasonably
sustained settlement for the past 20 years. The addition of small tree-fruit
orchards in each settlement, in total possibly adding another 2,500 ha to
tree-crop cultivation, has also been a small but significant factor in revers-
ing the trend to deforestation of the settlement area. A new program, only
recently initiated by COLONE, is designed to provide a one hectare farm
wood-lot of the tropical cassia (Cassia siamea) for each settler. This
reforestation of an additional 5,000 to 6,000 ha of forest in an area already
severely cut-over prior to the project would also be in accord (after the
fact) with project objectives.


1/   In preparation for the proposed Maranhao Rural Development Project,
     satelite imagery is currently being examined in order to estimate
     the area deforested in sub-area III.

                          X. CHANGES IN REPEATER PROJECTS


10.01     The early Alto Turi project execution experiences provided various
instructive insights in the preparation of subsequent Bank-financed projects
in Brazil. For example, as the integrated rural development projects for the
Northeast (the first in the State of Rio Grande do Norte) were being prepared,
the early participation of the state agencies to be involved in execution has
done much to improve the local sense of "ownership" of the project concept and
to broaden the consensus of the appropriateness of project designs, as well as
to avoid duplication of services and to ensure the continuity of such services.
It should not, however, be assumed no great differences exist between the
requirements of land settlement projects and rural development projects. The
organization implications of providing the initial basic infrastructure, and
legal titling of project lands are complex issues which have many political
overtones. Furthermore, solutions to these problems may well be area-specific
in some respects. Efforts to address such issues, and also environmental and
indigenous population protection, have been incorporated in preparation of
several proposed projects in the frontier areas of Northwest Brazil.


                              XI.   BANK PERFORMANCE


11.01           During the period of actual project implementation (commencing
in May 1974), the Alto Turi project showed major problems in six of the
supervision reports through December 1980. The remaining reports consistently
reported moderate problems. Following directly from its frequent appearance
on "Problem Project Reviews", studies by the Bank (OED) in early 1979 reported
on one of the consequences of unfavorable implementation performance, i.e.,
disbursement delays. A study to seek out the possible reasons for the causes
of the more general problems affecting implementation, i.e., a Supervision
Study, was made about the same time. 1/ As these reports, issued only
some 18 months prior to project completion, reflect a detailed and critical
analysis of Bank performance, during the years 1973 to 1978, inclusive, the
main conclusions drawn are referred to here.

11.02     Project Appraisal. The quality of Bank appraisal of the project
was, in retrospect, weak especially in that it did not adequately take account
of the following:

        (a) while land settlement seemed to have some priority in the existing
            Brazilian development strategy, the small Alto Turi "experiment"
            was not in the mainstream of the development effort;

        (b) the organizational structure--a new entity, with few built-
            in linkages to existing agencies--for project implementation
            was intrinsically weak;



1/   The Alto Turi Case Study was later incorporated into Report No. 2858
     "Operation Policy Review--The Supervision of Bank Projects", February 2,
        1980.
                                    - 79 -

     (c) a sufficiently broad Government consensus on the design of
         the Alto Turi settlement scheme was not achieved;

     (d) the arrangements for securing counterpart financing were not
         adequately worked out;

     (e) COLONE was not in full command of sufficient detail on all
         intended project components; and

     (f) several key factors in project planning, particularly related
         to essential infrastructure, were not well worked out in
         advance, leading to poor scheduling and subsequent delays.

The OED report concluded that, basically, two timely and fortuitous events
eventually assisted project implementation and consequently disbursements.
These were: (a) the establishment of POLONORDESTE (mid-1975) which eventually
provided counterpart funding for the project; and (b) the award of the
road construction to an influential contractor (Mendes, Jr.) who was able
to assist in securing federal support to finance the road component.

11.03     Project Supervision. Bank performance in project supervision
also experienced several shortcomings. As noted in the aforementioned OED
report, the major shortcomings appear to have been:

     (a) failure to take a strong stand earlier concerning the lack of
         counterpart funding;

     (b) reflecting probably more the appraisal than the quality of
         supervision, the need to accept a considerable change in project
         design less than four months after project effectiveness; and

     (c) failure to require a full project re-appraisal to evaluate changes
         to project timing, costs and benefits based on the revised design
         noted above.

11.04     While most problems concerning Bank performance during project
implementation had their origin in the key issues listed in paragraph 11.02,
the Bank reaction to such problems should probably have included:

     (a) more systematic consultations with and visits to other agencies
         relevant to project implementation, i.e., other than COLONE;

     (b) more systematic review of compliance with Loan covenants prior
         to the time such review became subject to routine inclusion in
         supervision reports;

     (c) closer supervision of end use of funds (accounts and
         audits were reviewed in Washington but not in the field by
         a financial analyst on supervision missions);

     (d) greater initial continuity in staffing of the supervision
         missions (this was only achieved after the first few years
         of project execution); and
                                      -   80 -


     (e)   greater delegation to mission member staff of authority to
           solve supervision problems in the field (Bank positions on
           various issues having been subject to delayed confirmation
           after mission returns).

11.05     Following completion of the OED reports, visits to SUDENE and
other key agencies following visits to the project area became a routine
facet of supervision missions. Invitations were also routinely extended for a
SUDENE technician to accompany the Bank missions in the field. An INCRA staff
member accompanied one supervision mission in the field and also the March
1981 mission for project completion purposes. Apart from the May 1976 mission,
no financial analyst was part of a supervision mission. The initial lack of
staff continuity is explained in part by:

     (a)   the Bank's major reorganization in September 1972, just
           after loan signing; and

     (b)   the reorganization of LCP Agriculture Divisions in July 1975.

While increased mission authority in the field would have facilitated handling
of various project problems, some of the major problems--i.e., requiring
higher level representation regarding project financing or reallocation of
funds between categories--by their nature required consultation in Washington.

11.06     An important summary conclusion of the OED reports was that,
even with a superior effort in the area of supervision, the project could not
be expected to overcome fully the initial flaws in design and concept.
                                    - 81 -

                 XII.   CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED


Project Design

12.01     The principle objective was to demonstrate the feasibility of
a low-cost approach to land settlement based upon a small-scale pilot or
experiment which would be applicable to larger projects in the future.
This objective was not adequately achieved. There is probably still reason to
believe that at the margin some of the administrative overhead costs (e.g.,
COLONE administrative overhead partially duplicating that of the other state
agencies) could have been lower had state agencies been more effectively
involved from the outset. Nevertheless, much of the cost increase was asso-
ciated with the delay in execution, which in turn reflected the fact that the
initial project design involved various technical and administrative weaknesses.

12.02     Project experiences do suggest, however, that, given timely and
appropriate financial support, a basic infrastructure of roads and the necessary
services, sustained settlement in the pre-Amazon area can be achieved with
reasonable economic viability. Health, education and farm support services
can be delivered at reasonable levels of efficiency, and family incomes can be
significantly improved as a result. In the Alto Turi case, the project effort
to demonstrate a "low cost approach to settlement was partly compromised by a
combination of problems in project design, a lack of broad consensus on
project design, unforeseen delays and a period of high inflation. Nevertheless,
this should not entirely negate the positive project achievements--i.e.,
significant increases to family incomes and living standards, based on rela-
tively small holdings.

12.03     Where answers to development strategy questions are indeed to be
sought by recourse to trial or experimentation, it seems in retrospect that
ideally there would need to be a much clearer consensus on and definition of
project objectives. Also, such "experiments" might be better made in project
areas less compromised by previous related efforts and where baseline data and
subsequent achievements can be more accurately established and measured for
comparative purposes.

Financing

12.04     Project financing arrangements, particularly for possible overruns,
should be much more thoroughly worked out prior to loan approval than was
apparently the case for this project. This may be especially true where the
Bank finances 100% of certain project categories under the loan, in which
case the need for counterpart financing, should cost overruns occur, becomes
a totally new budget commitment for the Borrower. Clearly, strong political
commitment to a project generally should also be a prerequisite to Bank
financing as it generally has a direct relationship to the level and
timeliness of counterpart funding forthcoming from the Borrower.

Selection of Executing Agency

12.05     The frequently chosen method of creating a "new" institution in
order to circumvent the problems of existing weak and poorly staffed institu-
tions can create very difficult problems in the long run. Such new companies
                                    - 82 -

can easily become isolated, unless they have strong political approval
and support at both the state and federal levels, and can also inadvertently
slow efforts to strengthen existing agencies. In the case of COLONE, efforts
to transfer operation and maintenance responsibilities to existing agencies
have been slow and extremely difficult. As noted in paragraph 8.05, COLONE's
future is still somewhat uncertain. Though the creation of this settlement
agency was probably necessary, the failure to involve other collaborating
agencies at an earlier date, and the lack of other clearly defined settlement
project work for COLONE outside the Alto Turi area, probably resulted in COLONE
taking on a broader role than would otherwise have been desirable.

Participation of State Agencies in Project Execution

12.06     The assumption that such agencies (road maintenance, health, educa-
tion, agricultural research and extension agencies) could rather easily absorb
programs previously developed and paid for by a different executing agent
does not, under the Alto Turi experience at least, appear to have been a
viable concept. The participation of all such agencies, commencing with
project preparation, is essential if they are to be involved with continued
participation in, and have future responsibility for, such services.

Farm Models, Land Use and Agricultural Research

12.07     An important lesson learned here is that proposals on farming
systems should not only be more realistic, but should be sufficiently flexible
to allow adjustments and variations to reflect changing conditions during the
project development period. Although at least tentative farm models are
necessary for the preparation of farm budgets, and appropriate economic
analysis purposes, they should not become straight-jackets. Research knowledge
concerning crop diversification possibilities and sustained yield improvements
is essential to the agricultural development process in a frontier region.
Also important are the establishment of adequate means to continue to assess
land use potential, to guide and adjust land use criteria, and to assure
reasonable attention to the protection of the environment. In the case
of the proposed Maranhao Rural Development Project, the strengthening of the
state agricultural research company (EMAPA) would appear to be essential for
providing the new agricultural production systems technology required.
In addition, planned reforestation and conservation work should strengthen
the attention given to environmental protection initiatives.

Road Network Design Standards

12.08     The tendency to routinely adopt "federal standards" for roads
appears to have led in Brazil to some occasional over-design and to related
cost overruns. The Bank agreed with the upgraded designs for project roads,
which in the circumstances was probably wise given the current difficulties in
organizing adequate maintenance. However, there is still probably scope for
considerable gains in Brazil in achieving a lower overall cost balance between
the investment for rural roads and the subsequent maintenance.

Need for Clear Land Titles

12.09     This lesson is rather obvious and yet, from a legal stand-point,
it was apparently possible for the Federal Government of Brazil to provide
a sufficiently sound legal opinion on the matter of COLONE's rights to
project land to provide the assurances to the Bank needed for loan effective-
ness. Matters such as land titles are crucial to many rural projects,
but especially to settlement initiatives. For the latter, the current
tenure situation and planned settler titling arrangements should, in fact,
be established clearly before loan approval, as adequate redress after the
fact is often difficult.

Establishment of Cooperatives

12.10     The wisdom of counting on project cooperatives for project success
could certainly be questioned, especially when: (a) there is not a high
degree of participation by settlers in the administration of the coopera-
tive; and (b) the cooperative and its members are not experienced in compli-
cated matters such as managing crop (short-term) and farm investment (long-term)
loan programs. "Forced" execution of credit management should be avoided,
allowing more gradual growth of simple cooperative functions. Also, more
adequate safeguards against the effects of bad debts should be incorporated
Into the cooperative's financing plan.

              The Farm Model: Basic Differences
                as Proposed by Bank and COLONE 1/


Farm Development Plan and Credit Programs

1.        The farm development plans recommended in the Bank Appraisal
Report were to settle families on 40-hectare lots so that these families
would produce their basic food requirements and rice and beef for sale.
The land would be gradually cleared over a period of years by family
hand labor, with initial crops of rice followed by pasture development
and a slow build-up of a cattle herd. COLONE officials still wished
to follow this general plan. The early revisions they proposed to the
plan were for the purpose of achieving a more rapid farm development
and a higher and earlier pay-out to the farmer. To achieve this
COLONE and the Government proposed increasing the amount of the credit
to farmers and extending the repayment and grace periods. COLONE and
the Government did not believe any of the changes that they were
proposing were inconsistent with the Loan or Project Agreements, since
they correctly made the point that these agreements did not describe
the farm development plans, the terms of farm credits, or the total
amount of credits to be extended.

2.        The mid-1973 Bank Supervision Mission reviewed the proposed
credit plans with COLONE and other officials and it was clear that the
modest Cr$2,480 medium-term credit (there was no provision for a long-
term credit) proposed in the Appraisal Report would have to be substan-
tially increased, if for no other reason, as a result of the sharp
increase in the price of livestock over the previous year. The
Appraisal Report contained no factors for contingencies or inflation.
In comparing the Bank and COLONE proposed credits, a reView was also
made of the credits proposed in the project as originally prepared by
the British consultant Hunting Technical Services, Ltd., which was
proposed by the Cooperative Programme for the Tapajos project, which
was a proposed settlement project for the development of 50-hectare units
in a region physically similar to Alto Turi.

3. The basic differences between the various proposals were as follows:

   (a) Amount of credit per settler

        Bank - Cr$2,480.
        COLONE - Cr$20,818.
        Hunting - Cr$11,141.
        Tapajos - Cr$34,200. (This figure included a 10 percent
        physical contingency factor and an annual 15 percent inflation
        factor.

   (b) Items financed

        Bank - Four cows, a bull and fencing. The credit covers
        80 percent of the cost of these items.
        COLONE - Nine cows, a bull, a working animal, fencing, a well,
        agricultural tools and the investment costs of half an acre
        of pepper plantings and 25 hectares of pasture.
        Hunting - Eighteen cows, a bull, fencing, a well and pasture
        seed.
        Tapajos - Nine cows, half a bull, house materials, tools and
        implements, rice seed and the investment costs of establishing
        subsistence crops and rubber.

   (c) Loan terms

        All of the proposed projects have a 7 percent nominal
        interest rate.

        Bank - 5 years repayment, including 2 of grace.
        COLONE - 12 years repayment, including 3 of grace.
        Hunting - 15 years repayment, with no grace period.
        Tapajos - 11 years repayment, including 3 of grace.

   (d) Net cash income at full development

        Bank - A net cash income of Cr$3,400 in settlement
        year 16.
        COLONE - A net cash income of Cr$22,570 in settlement
        year 9.
        Hunting - A net cash income of Cr$5,725 in settlement
        year 18.
        Tapajos - A net cash. income of Cr$16,200 in settlement
        year 14.

   (e) Herd size at full development

        Bank - 30 head in year 15.
        COLONE - 42 head in year 8.
        Hunting - 42 head in year 18.
        Tapajos - 42 head in year 14.

4.       COLONE officials criticized the Bank-proposed farm development
plan for supposing that all the cash income for rice production would
be able to meet the investment costs of the farmer. This, they said,
was impossible since the farmer must use the rice production for his
own subsistence and the purchase of subsistence commodities such as
salt, soap, matches, etc. They believed the Bank plan submitted the
farmer to unnecessary hardships and resulted in an income that was too
small and distant. Were this plan followed, they stated, only a small
percentage of the new settlers could be expected to continue and
establish stable farm units.

                             AUDIT NOTES ON MAPS




          The PCR, as originally submitted to OED, contained
three maps:

          - Map 1    -   general location of the project area

          - Map 2    -   project area

          - Map 3    -   indicates Indian reserve in relation to
                         project area


Map 1,1- which basically provided details about the 1969 national
highway network, was deleted as obsolete. Map 2 has been reprinted
and is included in the audit report: it gives project area details
as envisaged at appraisal. Map 3 has also been included in this
report.


          The audit has added two further maps:

          -   IBRD 16717 (November 1982), which provides details about the
              project areas as they were during the audit mission visit.

          -   IBRD 16191 (December 1981), which provides details about the
              follow-on project area.
