Some of the lessons learned from\n            the project are: 1) the need to appropriately sequence\n            project interventions, particularly in relation to\n            implementing required policy reforms and strengthening\n            institutional capacity before major expansion programs are\n            implemented; and 2) the lesson learned from the pilot\n            horticultural field trials relates to the importance of\n            collaboration among various agencies providing agricultural\n            services at the local level in strengthening\n            research/extension/farmer linkages for effective technology\n            dissemination, and its adoption by smallholder farmers."}, "docdt": "1998-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
