Bank performance has been highly satisfactory\n            during all phases of the Project. Borrower performance has\n            been highly satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as\n            follows: (i) the Bank maintained continuity in task\n            management and its relationships with government and Arab\n            Potash Company (APC); (ii) Government of Jamaica (GOJ)\n            provided guarantees for the establishment of needed\n            infrastructure and external financing; and (iii) the huge\n            reservoir of brine in the Dead Sea, together with energy\n            efficient use of solar ponds provide an opportunity for low\n            cost production of potash."}, "docdt": "1995-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
