The\n            Bank will support the government's strategy in its\n            critical efforts to improve Jordan's balance of\n            payments. The project has two components. The first will\n            support a substantial increase in Jordan's potash\n            export capacity from the current 1.4 million tons annually\n            to 1.8 million tons. This will be achieved through\n            optimization of Arab Potash Company's (APC) existing\n            plant. Implementation of this component is an important step\n            in APC's further financial recovery, enabling the\n            Company, once it has established a track record of\n            consistent profits, to attract private capital for its\n            future investment programs. The project will finance, under\n            international competitive bidding procedures, centrifuges\n            and other process equipment and an expansion of water\n            supply. The second component will help the Government and\n            APC through limited use of consultant advisory services to\n            formulate an investment strategy for developing new chemical\n            industries based on Dead Sea brine."}, "docdt": "1991-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
