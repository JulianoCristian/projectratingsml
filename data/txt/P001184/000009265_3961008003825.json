           participation; (b) improve power supply reliability, reduce\n            environmental impacts and reduce the cost of electricity by\n            supporting efficient gas-fired capacity using indigenous\n            natural gas developed under a private sector\n            Build-Own-Operate Transfer (BOOT) arrangement; and (c)\n            enhance operational reliability and
