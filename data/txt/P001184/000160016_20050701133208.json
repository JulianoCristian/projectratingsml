A\n            number of lessons have been derived from the experience of\n            the project and, it is hoped, will be learned by both the\n            Bank and its Borrowers. First, is the financing of a\n            private-sector project through the intermediation of\n            Government. Available private financing for projects in\n            Africa is very limited, even for countries with reasonable\n            economic performance because of the perception of high risk.\n            IDA presence in project financing through the Government and\n            on-lending to the private sector was crucial in making a\n            project of the private sector a reality. Such schemes, based\n            on a public-private partnership, are developing as a\n            sine-qua-non for encouraging investments in countries where\n            the perception of risk is high. Political and security\n            conditions were rated N (negligible risk) at appraisal but\n            reality proved otherwise. The ensuing instability and\n            hostilities have provided a rude test to the private\n            sector's confidence. In spite of the security problems\n            and of the general upheaval, the private sector maintained\n            its confidence in the sector because payments to independent\n            power producers (IPPs) continued during this period. This\n            was due primarily to the presence of the private sector\n            manager, which had an irrevocable mandate by the Government\n            to collect and make payments; this has minimized the adverse\n            perception of business risk by IPPs. The lesson here is that\n            a strong commitment by the Government to keep the private\n            sector whole, even at great sacrifice to itself, can carry\n            the day under the most adverse circumstances and can\n            mitigate the perception of risk which would, otherwise, be\n            forbiddingly high. The model used in this project should be\n            used in future project design. 8.3 Another important lesson\n            is the recognition that, for projects involving substantial\n            resource risk, a public-private partnership approach may be\n            necessary to ensure successful implementation. Even as the\n            country has in recent years discovered substantial resources\n            of natural gas and petroleum, the reliable supply of fuel on\n            a long-term basis is essential for secure power plant\n            operation. Furthermore, the pass-through arrangements for\n            gas provide additional comfort to private sector producers\n            because they do not have to deal with the uncertainty of\n            collecting adequate prices for the electricity produced as\n            the prices of fuel escalate, although the sector as a whole\n            must, eventually, internalize fuel cost increases and pass\n            them on to the consumers. Other lessons were related to\n            project design and operation, and institutional aspects."}, "docdt": "2005-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
