the Environment Impact\n            Assessment is to: 1) analyze and specify environmental\n            impacts; 2) examine the existing policy and legislative\n            measures; and 3) prepare mitigative measures and monitoring\n            plans for all adverse effects. The assessment analyzes\n            positive and negative impacts on atmospheric, terrestrial,\n            marine and human environments. It offers mitigation measures\n            for each environment and concludes that the project has a\n            positive impact on the overall environment. In addition, the\n            assessment estimates the costs created by environmental\n            demands and discusses institutional needs and public participation."}, "docdt": "1992-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
