objectives of the Second Technical\n            Training Project are: (a) to improve CONALEP's\n            operational efficiency and effectiveness; (b) increase the\n            supply of skilled workers and technicians; and (c) improve\n            the quality of training, instructor training, and materials\n            cost-recovery efforts.  The project also aims; (d) to\n            develop advanced maintenance systems for buildings and\n            equipment; and (e) to provide flexible support for the\n            program as a whole.  The project intends to provide\n            technical assistance to achieve the above objectives,\n            support the creation of 24 cost-recovery, pilot\n            \"production units\" and assist in the development\n            of about 97 technical training centers.  This provides an\n            additional enrollment capacity of 90,000 students in\n            training and up-grading programs."}, "docdt": "1985-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
