PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fifth Power
Project in Uruguay, for which Loan 1779-UR in the amount of US$24 million
was approved in March 1980. The Loan Agseement became effective on
December 11, 1980. The loan was closed on June 30, 1985, three years after
the original closing date (June 30, 1982). The project was completed in
December 1985, four years after the date anticipated at appraisal, mainly
because of slow and complicated procurement procedures. Despite these
delays, the borrower, Administracion Nacional de Usinas y Trasmisiones
Electricas (UTE), achieved the objectives of the project.
The PCX was prepared by the Energy Division of the Latin American
and Caribbean Regional Office based on information in Bank files and on
discussions with Bank staff.
Following standard OZD procedures a copy of the PCR was sent to
the borrower for comment, however, no comments were received by the
deadline.

,(LAN 1779-UR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Loan 1779-UR (24.0 million) helped to finance: (i) the renovation
and expansion of distribution systems in Montevideo and the connection to
the grid of isolated towns in the interior of the country; (1i) consultant
services for project management; and (iii) studies concerning management,
tariffs, development program, internal auditing, management information
systems, and the energy sector.
The pretfect achieved the objecri4ves set At appr4sal. The
investments in distribution helped to renew the network in Montevideo and
the interconnection-with the intL.ior and to allow the retirement of
uneconomical diesel generation plants. A least-cost expansion plan was
defined; a tariff study based on marginal costs was carried out; and the
preparation and Implementation of various masagement studies resulted in
iMprovements in the management and efficiency of UTE.
Project completion (December 31, 1985) occurred four years later
than anticipated during appraisal (December 31, 1981) mainly because of
slow pro,urement proce.ures. However, the ilitial estimate of the
implementation schedule had been unduly optimistic.
The Government did not increase tariffs to the extent agreed
during negotiations. After pressure from the Bank and during the last
three years of project implementation tariff increases were implemented
which resulted in an Improved financial performance.
UTE made considerable improvements during project implementation
in both the technical and managerial areas. However, the scope for further
improvement Is still significant. This is being addressed under loans
2484-UR and 262Z-UR.

FIF   POUR PROJECT
LOAN 1779-UR
I.* INTRODIJCTION
1.X. .    Bank LendAn to the Sector:
1.1.1    The Bank has made seven loans to Uruguay's power sectot- (Annex 1)
for a total of US$155.2 million (1950, loan 30-UR; 1955, loan 132-UR; 1956,.
loau 152-UR-I1?70, loan 712-UR; 1979, loan 1779-OR; 1984, loan 2484-UIR; and
1985, loan 262i-UR).             -
1.1.2    During the seventies, as a result of severe social conflicts and
i;ternal economic turmoil, the operations and financial positicsi of the
power sector deteriorated badly. Between the fourth and fifth power
projects,-a nine-year hiatus reflected the social and economic problems of
the country and the difficulties in reaching an tgreement with the
Government on the measures required to restore the sector back to a sound
position. As a result of a comprehensive review carried out during the
three years of preparation for the Fifth Project (1779-UR), the Bank
recomzend*d various measures to strengthen the sector and improve UTE's
performace.1 More recently the 3ank approved a power engineering loan
(2484-UR, in 1984) and a Power Sector Rehabilitation Project (2622-UR, in
1985) to reh b-1litate the Gabriel Terra Hydro Power Station. Through this
last loan the Bank also helped Uruguay to obtain voluntary lending from
external sources to help refinance the foreign exchange cost of the power
sector investment plan.
1.2.     Sector Organisationt
1.2.1    Most of Uruguay's energy sector is state controlled.  Electric
power policy is determined by the Government through the Ministry of
Industry and Energy (MIE). The most important operating entities are the'
national petroleu company, Administraci6n Nacional de Cementos, Alcohol y
Portland (ANCAP) and the power company, Administraci6n Nacional de Usinas y
Trasmisiones Elictricas (UTE). Electricity rates are approve4 by
Presidential decree. The Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Planning
and Budgeting Office (OPP) help determine electricity tariff levels with
primary decision-making powers vested in the latter.
1I  The Government passed a new Electricity Law and its corresponding
regulations, approved uew by-laws anA institutional-arrangements for
e --.t,and set up a mecfiuiism to allow automatic tariff increases when
input costs increased.



-2-
1.2.2    UTE is organized as an autonomous pvblic entity (its Board of
Directors is appointed by the Government) but its operations are subject to
legal and administrative constraints. UTE's budget has to be approved by
the Planning and Budgetcng Office, which places legal ceilings on the
company's investments and expendituras. The Government auditing agency
(Tribunal de Cuentas) is responsible for ensuring that UTE complies with
budget and procurement legislation. UTE's financial statements are audited
by a private firm of external auditors.
1.2.3    The only other entity that now operates in the power sector is the
Comisi6n Tecnica Mixta de Salto Grande (CTM). CTM was created in 1946, and
is a binational organization owned by the Governments of Argentina and
Uruguay and governed by a Board composed of four Argentine and four
Uruguayan members, all appointed by their respective Governments. CTM is
responsible for tle operation of the Salto Grande hydroplant.   Another
entity, Comision Hixta de Palmar (COMIPAL) was created iD 1973 to build the
El Palmar hydroplant. In line with the agreements reached tmnder loan
1779-UR, after its completion, El Palmar was transferred to UTE and COMIPAL
was dissolved by Law 15.700 of January 10, 1985.
1.2.4    Formally, the Ministry of Industry and Energy (MIE) is responsible
for long-range planning in the sector. After the oil price increase in
1973, the Direcci6n Naciona' de Energia was formed within the MIE to deal
with sector polit:ies, but ha. not yet been able to play a significant role.
So far no systematic energy planning has been carried out, and the
Government bas not defined a comprehensive energy policy.
1.2.5    Since the oil price Increases In the early 1970's, the key
Government objective has been to reduce Uruguayan dependence on Imported
fuel. In the power sector, f.ts strategy has been aimed at substituting
hydro for thermal generation. Th. potential for this substitution was
substantially achieved with the construction of the Salto Grande and El
Palmar hydroplants. A generation development study through the year 2000
made by independent consultants, under loan 1779-UR, has shown that none of
the identified small hydro projects can compete with. conventional thermal
plants. Thus, future fue_ savings will have to be achieved through more
efficent operation of UTE's generating plants and distribution systems,
loss reductions, and P%proved system planning and demand management through
pricing policies which take marginal costs into account.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1      Prolect Oritin
2.1.1    In 1976, the Government asked the Bank to help finance  a
distribution program. Due to UTE's precarious situation, the Bank
requested a comprehensive program, including legal changes, to strengthen
the power sector and to Improve UTERs performance.



-3-
2.1.2    The Government indicated its agreement to the program and
initiated corresponding action. On that assurance, the Bank and the Inter-
American Development Bank (IDB) decided to process two linked loans to
support UTE's transmission and distribution investment programs.
2.1.3    UTE hired consultants under tetrs of reference acceptable to the
Bank and to IDB, to prepare a tranasmssion and distribution study. This
study was ready by the second semester of 1977.
r
2.2      Project-Preparation and Aporaisal
2.2.1    After the Government initiated actions to address UTE's problems
the Bank sent a mission to appraise the 1978-81 distribution program. This
mission took place in October 1977 and was followed by an IDB mission to
appraise the transmission program shortly thereafter.
2.2.2    Subsequent to this appraisal mission it proved Impossible to reach
agreement with the Uruguayan authorities on the scope of the changes needed
in UTE's management structure. Further delays occurred Lecause of UTE's
slowness in issuing calls for the various consulting services required for
the project and the difficulty in reaching agreement with the Government on
the text of the regulations to the Electricity Law. These matters were
finally resolved in April 1979 and the project was reappraised in the
following month.
2.2.3    The key issues raised at appraisal weres
(a) the amount of Government contributions to power sector
financing requirements;
(b)   unsatisfactory levels of electricity rates;
(o)   tariff structure not conductive to an efficient use of
electricity;
(d)   lack of a generation expansion program based on least cost
criteria;
(e)   declining number of qualified management and professional
staff due to inadequate salary levels plus lack of policies
for recruitment and training; and
(f)   need of a master energy plan to define the measures to foster
fuel economization.
Comuitments on these matters were obtained during negotiations. (para 2 5)
2.3.     Proiect Obiectives
2.3.1    The objectives of the Project were to Improves
(a)   the operational efficiency of UTE, by renovating the
distribution network in Montevideo and phasing out
uneconomical local diesel generating plants in the interior;



-4-
(b) UTE's management efficiency and financial practices through
procedures to be developed with the assistance of consultants;
(c)   sector policies through appropriate legislative changes, an
energy sector study, a development study, and a tariff study.
2.4.     Proiect Description:
2.4.1    The project comprised a portion of the 1980-83 development program
of UTE and covered:
(a) renovation and expansion of distribution networks in
Montevideo;
(b)   expansion and some renovation of distribution networks in the
interior and connection to the grid of isolated towns; and
(c)   consultant services for project management and studies
concerning management, tariffs, development program, internal
auditing, management information systems, and the overall
energy sector.
2.5     Negotiations, Presentation and Effectiveness
2.5.1   Negotiations started on August 28, 1979.  Representatives of the
Bank, UTE and the Goverment reached agreements that:
1. The Government would:
(a)   prepare a program for financing the power sector;
(b)   adjust UTE's rates to meet covenanted rates of return (target
rate of return of 7.5S) and UTE's financing needs; and
(c)   carry out an energy study.
2. UTE would carry out studies of:
(i)  the tariff structure using marginal cost criteria;
(ii) generation development study to define further expansion
program;
(iii) management organization and efficiency;
(iv) salary levels and structure.
2.5.2.   The following events were specified as conditions to the
effectiveness of the loan agreement:
(a)  enactment of new by-laws for UTE and corresponding regulations;
(b)  signature of the IDB Loan Contract for t'he transmission expansion
program;
(c) progress on the part of the Government regarding payments of its
electricity bills;



(d) Government authorization for UTE to carry out all procurement
required for the Project; and
(e) engagement of independent auditors.
2.5.3    Bank approval occurred on December 13, 1979.  Loan and Guarantee
Agreements were signed on March 6, 1980 and the Loan Agreement became
effective on December 11, 1980.
2.5.4    Loan conditions weres asmount, was US$24.0 million; term, 15 years
including 3 years of grace period; interest rate, 7.95S per annum (fixed);
and commitment fee, 314 of 12.
2.6 Maior Covenants of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements.
2.6.1.   UTZ and the Government complied with all the major covenants,
except for the following conditions which were not fully mets
(a) Section 5.04 (a) of the loan agreemnmt and section 4.07 of Guarantee
Agreement, requiring tariff adjustments to achieve a rate of return of 7.5S
in 1980 and each year thereafter. The tariff increases authorized by the
Government did not allow UTE to achieve the target rate of return of 7.5s.2
During 1980, UTE's rate of return was 2.61. In the following years it was:
1981=(0.4)%; 19823(2.5)Z; 1983-1.8S; 1984-2.02 and 1985-1.O0.
(b) Section 5.07(i) of the Loan Agreement and section 4.06 (a) of the
Guarantee Agreement requiring the Government to pay and cause each of its
departments and national agencies to pay all their outstanding debts to UTE
as of December 31, 1979 and to pay to UTE all services rendered or to be
rendered after January 1, 1980 within 75 days after date of billing. As of
1985, the last year of the project implementation; the arrear periods were
the following: (a) Central Governments 81 days (b) National Agenciest 91
days (c) Municipality of Montevideo: 351 days (d) other municipalities 285
days.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS
3.1.  Imglementation of the Proiect
3.1.1.   Project completion (December 31, 1985) occurred four years later
than anticipated during appraisal (December 31, 1981). Project completion
was delayed mainly because of slow and complicated procurement procedures.
It must be noted, however, that the project implementation schedule
estimated at appraisal was very optimistic, as it was much shorter than the
standard Bank profile for distribution projects. Also, there was a delay
in effectiveness due to the long time required for the enactment of the
decree granting to UTE the necessary authorization to carry out all
pgocurement, as required under section 7.01 (d) of the loan agreement.
Annex 3 shows a comparison between the appraisal estimate and the actual
project implementation schedule.
2/ Note, however, that due to assoet revaluation significantly in excess of
the levels anticipated at appraisal, the figures shown are not strictly
comparable tp the targets set at negotiatidns (para. 2.5.1). Under
loan 2622-UR the rate of return covenant was lowered to 62, to take
this into account.



-6-
3.2. Project Costs
3.2.1. The actual project cost was very close to the appraisal estimate.
The actual cost was US$52.48 million including actual physical
contingencies and price escalation. However the actual local and foreign
costs were different from the appraisal estimates. Local costs were 41
higher than the appraisal estimate and foreign costs 41 lower. This was
mainly due to the evolution of the exchange rate which resulted in lower
equipment prices and,higher local costs in distribution lines in the
interior. In view of internal inflation and changes in the relative costs
of equipments and services which distort the comparability of the cost
figures, costs comparisons should be used with caution. Annex 4 compares
the actual and forecast cost by project component.
3.3. Procurement. Consultants and Contractor's Performance
3.3.1.  UTE's procurement processing was slow and lengthy, due to
complicated internal and external regulations as well as insufficient
training of UTE's staff in these matters. The internal issues were
partially addressed by tITE through specialized training courses for its
personnel and the acquisition of micro-computers to process information
connected with the procurement process. As these actions took place only
in 1985, the results will only be reflected in future projects. The legal
framework, including mandatory intervention of the Tribunal de Cuentas, and
lengthy appeal procedures remain cumbersomne and deserve review at the
country level, since they impact all sectors and projects.
3.3.2. The procurement of goods and works was carried out under Bank's
guidelines without major problems. The first contract was awarded in June
1981 and the last one in April 1985. Annex 5 shows details of the
different contracts of the project.
3.3.3.  The consultants engaged for this project had performance
considered satisfactory by the Borrower and by the Bana. Annex 6 shows
details of the different consultant performances.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.1. Justification of the Proiect
4.1.1. The appraisal report justified the undertaking of the Project
because it would Improve quality of service and would allow meeting
forecast demand growth, accompanying the recovery of economy, utilizing the
energy production of the hydro power plants of Salto Grande and Palmar.
The connection of isolated towns would result in sizeable fuel savings and
the distribution facilities financed under the project would bring hydro
energy to the final consumers, reduce losses and improve the efficiency of
UTE's operations and the reliability of service. The project also involved
major institutional changes aiming to reverse UTE's finaicial and
institutional deterioration during the decade of the 70's.



-7-
4.2. Results Achieved:
4.2.1. The project substantially achieved the desired objectives. The
investments in the distribution system helped to renew the network in
Montevideo and to phase out uneconomical diesel generating plants in the
interior. A least cost program for generation expansion was defined and a
tariff study based on marginal cost criteria was completed. -The expansion
program is being followed, and in accordance with its recomuendations, the
Bank is financing the rehabilitation of the Gabriel Terra Hydro Plan (loan
2622-tR). The revision of the tariff structure based on marginal costs was
not implemented as promptly as expected and is only now in process of
initial application. The Bank is financiAg, under loan 2484-UR, the
acquisition of the meters that would allow time of day metering under loan
2484-UR. The various management studies (staff compensation structure;
planning unit implementation; internwl auditing, financial reporting;
management information systems) were carried out satisfactorily. The
energy study was prepared and completed, but was not followed-up and a
mater energy plan was not developed. The Bank is pursuing this issue
under subsequent projects.
4.2.2. Very important results of this project were the new legislation
that it helped to obtain (new by-laws for UTE) and the separation of UTE
from Administraci6n Nacional de Telecommunications (ANTEL). These,
associated with the management studies carried out by consultants, resulted
in substantial improvement in UTE's management efficiency and financial
practices.
4.3. Market
4.3.1.   Up to 1981, the demand growth followed the estimates made at
appraisal but from 1982 on, the recession in the economy lowered
considerably the load growth. As a result, the actual sales of energy in
1985 were lower than the sales of energy for 1983 as estimated in the
appraisal report. This lower market growth partially offset the negative
impact caused by the delay in the implementation of the project. Annex 7
shows the estimated and actual sales of energy.
V. FINANCIAL PERPORMANCE
5.1      Actual and Forecast Financial Performance
5.1.1   Annex 8 discusses the actual and forecast financial performance
of UTE during the years 1980-1983 and actual financial performance
during the years 1984-1985. Attachments 1-4 _ annex 5 compare actual
and forecast income statements, sources and applications of funds,
balance sheets, and ratios of financial performance for the years 1980-
1983; and set forth actual data for the years 1984 and 1985. Attachment 5
sets forth actual average revenue per kWh sold in current and constant
prices stated in pesos for the years 1980-1985.



-8-
5.1.2    UTE failed to earn its covewnnted rate of return (7.52) during any
of the above years, and this led to consideration of suspension of
disbursements. With difficulties and delays the Bank was able to persuade
the Government to increase UTE's tariffs and -by and large- the overall
financial performance was acceptable, though the rate of return that had
been coiienanted was not achieved. After 1982 the Government raised tariffs
to levels more in line with the agrements and during 1983-1985, the
financial performance of UTE showed improvement.
5.1.3    Except for the levels of actual and forecast summary sales
(11,519 GWh vs. 11,736 GWh), actual and forecast suimary financial
results are not comparable due to a variety of factors wi$ch greatly
changed financial magnitudes and the ratios of financial performance.
These factors included a change in the methodology for asset
revaluation (in 1980), delays in the transfer of works constructed by
other power authorities (in 1980 and 1982), and Government policy with
respect to rates of exchange (from 1980 to 1982). Annex 8 discusses these
factors in detail on a year-by-year basis.
5.1.4    Financial supervision was continuous (p. iii)s once in 1980; twice
in 1981; three times in 1982; and annually thereafter.
5.2      Rate of Return
5.2.1    At appraisal the rate of return for the 1980-83 UTZ investment
program using revenues and taQxe on power sales as a proxy for benefits
has been estimated at about 7%. On the basis of actual data, the rate of
return was 4.72. (Annex 10). This lower rate of return was partly due to
lower sales than forecasted at appraisal and mostly to tariff levels lower
than covenanted with the Government.  To show the influence of tariffs a
simulation was made calculating the rate of return based on a tariff equal
to the one used in the appraisal report; the resulting rate of return was
132.
VI. I.JSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.1      The Borrower
6.1.1    During the period of 1980-85, UTE made valuable progress in
financial management, system planning, operation and project management.
The improvements in organization and management aspects were important. At
the beginning of the Project, UTE was still merged with ANTEL, and did not
have a planning unit with design capabilities. During project execution
the separation of UTZ from ANTEL was completed, the reorganization of UTE
took place, the Planning Unit was established, and management and financial
studies were carried out. The creation of the Planning Unit enabled UTE to
oontrol its budget and investment program. A recruitment program to
strengthen technical staffing was implemented, and some measures were taken
to improve the compensation structure. Management'training was started and
reporting systems were improved.



-9-
6.1.2    Despite these improvements in technical and managerial capability,
UTE still has inadequate management delegation, cumbersome procurement
procedures and poor inventory management. To address this problem UTE
created an internal group to deal with procurement and internal control
matters. Under loan 2484-UR, UTE agreed to submit to the Bank an action
plan for improving inventory management.
6.2      The Government
6.2.1    The Government supported UTE in carrying out the project.
Initially, the electricity law was approved and afterwards a decree
authorizing UTE to carry out all procurement required for the Project *ras
passed. The Government improved the payment of electricity bills reducing
the arrears to UTE from about the equivalent .o 15 months of sales to about
3 months of sales but, was unable to assist UT! in improving its
collections from municipalities. However Government procedures in all
matters requiring approval were slow and the Ministry of Industry and
Energy failed to achieve the leadership and policy making role for the
sector that had been expected at appraisal.
6.3      The Bank
6.3.1    The Bank made important contributions to the Project and to UTE's
development programs in general. Its managerial, technical, and financial
covenants and its constant pressure on UTE and on the Government were
decisive factors for the completion of the project and helped to achieve
the tariff increases that occurred in the last years of the project.
6.3.2 2   The Bank support was also important. The supervision work was
intensive, with 10 missions during 6 years. The technical support given by
the Bank to UTZ was very important to the success of the project. During
the execution of the project the Bank approved twvo additional loans to UT!:
(a) loan 2484-UR for engineering services and acquisition of meters to
implement marginal cost-based tariffs; and (b) loan 2622-UR for the
rehabilitation of Gabriel Terra Hydroplant and the associated transmission
system, as recomuended by the expansion plan prepared under fifth Power
Project (loan 1779-UR).
VII. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
7.1      The Protect
7.1.1    On balance and based on project objectives, the Fifth Power
Project should be judged as successful. Although there wa a delay in the
completion of the physical components of the project, the objectives set at
appraisal were achieved. The actual project cost was approximately equal to
the appraisal estimate.
7.2      The Borrower and the Guarantor
7.2.1   The Guarantor had the responsibility of developing an Energy
Master Plan. The studies funded by the loan were satisfactorily completed



- 10 -
but the plan was not developed. In this sAbject the Bank may have been at
fault in including a project component for which country commitment seems
to have been tenuous, and with a very weak Implementing agency as its
counterpart (Direcci6n Nacional de Energia). The Bank, under the loan
2484-UR (Section 3.02 of the Guarantee Agreement), has now requested a plan
of action to implement the Energy Plan. However, much should be done yet
to achieve reasonable results because Direccin Nacional de Energia
continues to be a very weak agency.
7.2.2    The Guarantor covenanted to increase electricity rates to enable
UTE to achieve a rate of return of 7.52. This did not occur and only after
pressure from the Bank the tariff increases in the last three years of the
project.permitted UTE to increase its rate of return, even without
achieving 7.52. In this matter the Bank followed a flexible approach
taking into account the constraints faced by the Guarantor because of the
deterioration of the economy, and frequently reassessing the financing plan
of the Borrower. When lack of compliance Impaired the Borrower's ability
to stick to such plan, the Bank took a strong stand and suspension of
disbursements was considered in April 1982. Fortunately, disbursements
were not suspended but, by and large, this approach was productive as it
resulted in an i'ninterrupted dialogue and, in the end, in the improvement
of sector finances.
7.3      Procurement
7.3.1    Procurement was split into an adequate number of contracts.  The
Bank should discuss procurement subjects with the Government in order to
improve procurement procedures and regulations to speed up the process.
This would help Improve project implementation across sectors.  Meanwhile,
the Bank should take UTE's lengthy procurement process into consideration
when establishing project timetables.
7.4      Supervision
7.4.1    The close supervision of the project by Bank missions in the field
was decisive for the success of the project. Slowness of procedures in
Uruguay suggest that significant benefits can be achieved through frequent
supervision missions.

Actual Financial Performance. 1980-1985
1.       Actual and Forecast Financial Data
1.01    Attachments 1 to 4 compare actual and forecast financial data for
the years 1980-1983 with respect to income and expenses, sources and
applications of funds, balance sheets, and ratios of financial
performance. These attachments also set forth actual data for the years
1984 and 1985. Attachment 8.5 sets forth actual average revenue per
kWh sold in current and constant (1980) prices stated in pesos. As
discussed below, events fell short of expectations in a number of areas
(para. 5.1.2) and resulted in substantial differences between actual and
forecast data. The following paragraphs discuss the information in the
attachments.
2.       Actual Financial Performance. 1980-1983
2.01     In 1980, the financial performance of UTE was satisfactory but
actual and forecsst indicators of financial performance and actual and
forecast financial values differed significantly. These differences
did not extend to actual and forecast sales levels, which were closes
2,706 GWh vs. 2,692 GWh.
2.02     Among the differing ratios was the actual rate of return, 2.6Z,
as compared with the covenanted return, 7.51. But because of high revenue
levels and low levels of debt service and investment expenditure, the debt-
service coverage and self-financing ratios were much higher than expected
(respectively, 6.5z vs.3.4z; and 1142 vs.23Z). In constant 1980 prices,
actual average revenue per kWh sold (Nr$0.653) was almost 162 higher than
that of 1979 (Nr$0.563) due to periodic tariff increases. These tariff
increases were designed to cover increasing operating costs, especially
rising depreciation expenses which resulted from the extraordinary
revaluation of assets (see para. 2.04).
2.03     Actual revenues from electricity;sales (US$194.3 million) were
considerably higher than forecast levels (US$163.1 million)* as were
depreciation expenses (US$55.1 million vs. US$18.0 million) and net
internal cash generation (US$87.1 million vs. US$37.2 million).
Contributing to the high level of net internal cash generation were
high levels of other operating income and other income (US$3t.0 million
and US$4.6 million, respectively; see Attachment 8.1, footnotes 4 and
5).  Actual and forecast levels of debt service were closes
US$15.9 million vs. US$15.8 million., Had connection fees been included,
the rate of return would have increased to 5.OZ. The bank did not insist on



- 20 -
compliance with the rate-of-return covenant, given the more than adequate
level of internally generated funding available to cover investment needs.
2.04     Factors accounting for the different levels of actual and forecast
financial results includeds (i) a revaluation of assets required by UTE'a
auditors, in accordance with a valuation study which the Bank had
requested, resultVmg in a very sizeable increase in the rate-base
(Attachment 8.3, footnote 2). Net internal cash generation was higher than
expected at appraisal, reflecting a very sizeable increase in depreciation
charges. (ii) lower-than-expected levels of investment expenditure (US$76.0
million vs. US$162.0 million) and net borrowing (US$0.7 million vs.
US$110.2 million). Revaluation increased the value of assets to US$753.2
million as compared with the appraisal estimate of US$324.7 million. The
low level of investment expenditure was due to late effectiveness of the
IDB and World Bank loans. In these circumstances, UTE accumulated large
cash balances (US$Ol. million) as compared with the appraisal estimate
(US$14.0 million).
2.05     A third factor weakening the comparability of actual and
forecast results in 1980 was the macroeconomic policy of the Government.
For example, in 1980 the devaluation of the peso against the US dollar was
19% while the rate of domestic inflation was 342 (as measured by the cost-
of-living index). If the rate of devaluation had been the same as the rate
of domestic inflation, the average revenue per kWh sold would have been
about 63.7 US mills (as compared with the forecast level of 60.6 US
mills) rather than 71.8 US mills. The Government changed its exchange rate
policy in November 1982.
2.06     In 1981, the financial performance of UTE began to deteriorate,
but the financial ratios were not uniformly poor. While actual and
forecast sales were close (2,901 GWh vs. 2,848 GWh), actual and
forecast ratios of financial performance and many financial aggregates
differed. The Government raised tariffs twice (February, 32; August
152) in line with devaluation, but these increases were not sufficient
to maintain the real level of average revenue per kWh sold, which
decreased 11.22 as compared with that of 1980 (N$0.575 vs. N$0.653); and
UTE earned a negative rate of return (-0.42). Even with the negative rate
of return, actual and forecast levels of net internal cash generation were
close (US$44.8 million vs. US$43.1 million) and the debt-service coverage
and self-financirg ratios were strong, if below the levels expected at
appraisal (2.7x vs. 3.0x; and 252 vs. 502). The lower-than-expected self-
financing ratio reflected the higher-than-expected investment expenditures
(US$179.3 million vs. 85.6 million) due to the transfer in 1981 of the
Salto Gra-zde transmission lines. At appraisal, this transfer had been
expected to occur in 1980. By December 1981, UTE had reduced its cash
balance to US$9.7 million as compared with US$30.1 million at the end of
1980. As the net internal cash generation of UTE was al,ropriate to its
needs, the Bank did not insist on compliance with the rate-of-return
covenant.
2.07     In 1982, the financial deterioration of UTE continued, but again
the financial ratios were not uniformly poor. Due to macroeconomic
factors, actual sales (2,908 GWh) were 3.5% less than expected (3,013
GWh). The Government, to keep tariffs in line with the rate of
devaluation, raised tariffs only twice: 52 in February and 12.6% in



- 21 -
June. These increases resulted in a level of average revenue per kWh
sold (NUr$0.575, stated in 1980 prices) which was 3.8S greater than
that of the previous year; but the increases were not sufficient to
permit UTZ to avoid a negative rate of return: -2.52. The Bank was
extremely concerned about this situation and considered threatening
suspending disbursements. However, because debt service remained low
and because of the deferral of the transfer of the Palomar hydroelec-
tric plant, the debt-service coverage and self-financing ratios
continued to be strong: 2.6 x vs. 2.3 xz and 48.1X vs. 10.72. As the
net internal cash generation was appropriate to the needs of UTZ, the
Bank decided not to insist on compliance with the rate-of-return
covensut. On November 25, 1982, the Government announced its decision
to float the peso; and thereafter, the Government began to take actions
to restore the financial position of UTE.
2.08     In 1983, the financial performance of UTZ began to improve; but
the improvment was not uniform. Due to a succession of tariff increases
(Januarys 39%; April: 182; September 14Z), average revenue per kWh sold
(N$0.698) was 16.92 higher than In 1983; and UTZ earned a rate of return of
1.81. Including connection fees, the return was 2.91. However, a large
increase in debt service related to the belated transfer of the Palmar
hydroelectric station reduced debt-service coverage to 1.0 x and left no
internally generated funding to cover investment requirements (US$613.6
million). Such requirements were covered by equity contributions (US$78.6
million), long-term borrowing (US$318.0 million), and net changes in
working capital (US$17.1 million). All of these financial variables
differed substantially from their appraisal counterparts. Believing that
in the context of Uruguay's economic difficulties, the Government had done
all that could realistically be expected with respect to increase tariffs,
the Bank waived the rate-of-return covenant in 1983, provided that UTE
furnished a comprehensive financial program.
2.09     In 1984 and 1985, the rates of return oL UTE were 2.01 and 1.01,
respectively; the debt-service coverage ratios wero 1.0 x and 0.6s; and the
self-financing ratios were 15.32 and negative. As the Government continued
to raise tariffs in real terms (4.31 in 1984 and 2.72 in 1985) in spite of
very difficult economic conditions, the Bank took an understandivg view of
the situation and went on with the appraisal of two new projects (loans
2484-UR and 2622-UR) under which UTE's financial undertakings were revised.
Since most of UTE's financial problems after 1983 arose from the inadequate
terms on which Palmar had been financed, the Bank assisted in mounting a
financing strategy to roll over UTZ's debt. This approach provided a
significant contribution to the resolution of UTE's financial
difficultities.

(a)  Actual UTE's investment program during the period of  implementation of
the project.
(b) The large difference of incremental operational expenses for periods
1980182 is due to sharp increase in oil prices during the period
compared with beginning of 1979, and for the period 1983/85 is mainly.
due to the sharp reo.ction of oil eonsumption after 1983 due to
availability of new hydroelectric facilities.
(c) Actual tariffs of 7.2 US$Cents/kWh In 1980; 7.1 US$Cents/kWh in 1981;
6.9 US$CentalkWh in 1982; 4.8 US$Cents/kWh in 1983; 4.1 US$Cents/kWh
in 1984; 4.7 US$Cents/kVh in 1985; 6.2 US$CentslkWh in 1986. The very
low values observed for incremental sales in 1983, 1984 and 1985 are
the result of low market growth (see Annex 7) and sharp reduction of
tariffs from 7.4 US cents/XWh to 4.1 US cents/kWh.
