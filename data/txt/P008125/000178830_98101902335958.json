development program consists\n            of the installation by 1983 of about 680 km of transmission\n            lines, about 2,030 km of distribution lines, 251 substations\n            to increase service of consumers from the present 790,000 to\n            about 900,000 by 1983. The project comprises a portion of\n            the 1980-83 works for: (a) renovation and expansion of\n            distribution networks in Montevideo; (b) expansion and some\n            renovation of distribution networks in the interior; and (c)\n            consultant services for project management and studies\n            concerning management, tariffs, development program,\n            internal auditing and management information systems, and\n            the energy sector. The project aims at (a) helping finance\n            major investments in the distribution facilities of UTE; (b)\n            improving the operational efficiency of UTE by renovating\n            the distribution network in Montevideo and phasing out\n            uneconomical local diesel generating plants in the interior;\n            (c) improving UTE's management efficiency and financial\n            practices through new legislation, regulations and\n            assistance from consultants; and (d) improving sector\n            policies through appropriate legislative changes, an energy\n            sector study, a development study and a tariff study."}, "docdt": "1979-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
