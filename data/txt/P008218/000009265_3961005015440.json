the level of student\n            achievement, reduce the incidence of repetition and dropout,\n            and increase graduation rates of basic education through\n            improvements in the quality of education and administrative\n            efficiency.  Because education is moving toward being\n            decentralized, another important objective of the project is\n            to help states develop their own capacity for managing the\n            system efficiently.  Toward these ends the project will:\n            (a) increase student access to textbooks and other\n            instructional materials; (b) improve teachers' skills\n            and effectiveness in teaching; (c) improve the education\n            management capacity of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and\n            of the State Education Secretariats (SES); and (d) develop\n            MOE's capacity to coordinate and formulate policies,\n            monitor student learning and school quality, and identify\n            bottlenecks and problems at the state and local levels in a\n            timely manner.  The project consists of four components:\n            (a) instructional materials development; (b) teacher\n            training; (c) institutional development; and (d) studies of\n            school effectiveness and educational finance and the\n            identification and design of activities to improve the\n            quality of education."}, "docdt": "1993-10-13T00:00:00Z"}
