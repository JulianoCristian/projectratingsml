both\n            performances by the Bank, and Borrower are rated\n            satisfactorily. Nonetheless, several lessons drawn from the\n            project suggest the following. It is once again reinforced\n            that project design, particularly if directed at improving\n            education quality, should be simple, with limited, and few\n            components and implementing agencies, to allow enough\n            flexibility to adapt to the changing requirements of a\n            dynamic education system. Furthermore, design should also\n            provide for effective implementation capacity on the part of\n            the borrower, since weak capacity, or untrained project\n            units, may lead to operational standstill as a result of\n            project complexity. The introduction of educational\n            innovation could fail, unless a clear understanding is\n            developed between teachers, and political leaders, on the\n            value of supplementary educational financing - based upon\n            autonomous assessment of local weaknesses, and needs - and,\n            provided that technical capacity, developed toward project\n            objectives, remains within the system. In addition, quality\n            improvement projects, with direct interventions in the\n            operation of an educational system, should define, and\n            engage institutional roles among all agencies, and the\n            Ministry staff having operational responsibilities,\n            regardless of whether design and preparation are\n            commissioned to outside consultants."}, "docdt": "2000-10-23T00:00:00Z"}
