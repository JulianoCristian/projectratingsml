LAn ad Project Iumarn
ForXowers: Bursa Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (BUSKI)
Bursa Metropolitan Municipality (SHI)
Guarantor: Republic of Turkey
Loan Qogn US$117.0 million equivalent to BUSKI
US$12.5 million equivalent to BMM
Total of US$129.5 million equivalent.
Term:       Seventeen years, includlng five years grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Project
ObjictLyes: The main objectives of the proposed project are: (i) to improve
environment condltions and reduce health hazards in Greater Bursa;
(iL) to improve the management of mmnicipal water supply, sewer
services, and of domestic, industrial and clinical solid wastes;
(iii) to meet the demand for water supply, sewerage, flood
protection and solid waste services, including the demand from the
poor livlng on the fringes of the city; (iv) to postpone the need
to develop new water resources by increasing the efficiency of
water usage by reducing the volume of non-revenue water; and, (v)
to implemant appropriate cost recovery policies.
Desgriptlon The project has two distinct parts. The water supply, sewerage
and storm water part with: (i) water supply works needed to
renovate, rehabilitate, and extend the existing system; (ii)
sewerage works needed to extend the collection networks,
reconstruct sewer connections, and treat wastewater in two plants;
(iii) storm water drainage works needed to rehabilitate the
exlsting networks, and extend the collection system in flood
areas; and (iv) technical assistance for project implementation
(engineering services and Project Management) and for
institutional development (reduction of unaccounted-for water,
training, asset management system, management and information
system, tariff study and feasibility of leasing arrangements).
The solid waste part with: (i) rehabilitation of the existing
dump site, developument of a now landfill site, construction of a
waste transfer station; (Li) vehicles and containers to collect
waste, including incineration of clinical waste; and (iii)
technical assistance for project implmentation (engineering
services) and for institutional development (establishment of a
regulatory unit, separate management of solid waste, separate
collection and treatment of clinical and industrial waste, and
contracting out of part of domestic waste collection).



It
and Riska: The project would have major benefits stemming from: (1)
improved operatioval officiency of WBUKI and the solid waste
management of the Municipality; (li) promotion of local resource
mobilization and cost recovery; (iLL) reduction in the health
hazards to the local and tourist population; (iv) reduction of
losses in property and labor productivity resulting from frequent
flooding; and (v) improvement of environmental conditions. The
risks relate to: (i) institutional weakness of the borrowers for
timely project preparation and implementation; and (ii) the
willingness and ability of local authorities to adopt resource
mobilization and cost recovery measures necessary to generate
sufficlent counterpart funds. Project preparation and design aim
to minimize these risks.

1.01        Greater Bursa is the fifth largest Turkish city (840,000 people in
1990), but the first in terms of population growth rate (5.5X per year). The
city is industrial (food processing, textiles, vehicle manufacture, and
machinery production), and touristic (9,000 hotel beds in 1989).
1.02        Water supply and sewerage services in Bursa are provided by a
municipal authority (BUSKI), with moderate private sector involvement (meter
reading and billing, and meter repair and installation). Ninety percent of
the population is served by water supply connections, and 70X by sewerage
connections. Domestic and industrial wastewater is currently discharged
without any treatment into the nearest streams, which empty into the Sea of
Marmara (20 km away from Bursa), which is already v-der environmental pressure
as a result of rapid industrialization in the area (Istanbul, Izmit, Bursa).
Pollutants have degraded water quality in surface and ground water and have
contributed to degrade the Sea of Marmara. This has had negative impacts on
water supply, fisheries, health, and recreation. The efficiency in the
provision of water and sewerage services is low. This iS highlighted by the
excessively high level (63X) of non-revenue water due to physical leaks,
administrative losses (illegal connections, under-registration of moters,
etc.), and water free to certain public uses. This results in pressure for
premature development of new water resources.
1.03        Solid waste services are provided by the Municipality.  Domestic
solid wsste is disposed in an open dump site where garbage is left uncovered;
and industrial and clinical solid wastes are disposed with poor regard to the
environment or the public safety.
1.04        Bank involvement in the sector in Turkey has been generally
succesful in meeting the physical targets for the projects, and in encouraging
the Government to establish municipal water companies, including the recently
created (1989) BUSKI. The proposed project, building on the experience of
previous projects, contains a major institutional development component.
1.05        The project has two distinct parts: a water supply, sewerage and
storm water part, with BUSKI as borrower and a solid waste part, with Bursa
Metropolitan Municipality as borrower.

2.01        The population of Turkey in 1990 was estimated at 56.5 million,
with 59X living in urban areas. Population growth averaged 2.4X during 1980-
89. The overall growth rate is expected to average 2.0X during 1989-2000 and
reach 68 million by the year 2000. Rural migration to urban areas io expected
to continue and to constitute a major cause of growing demand for water,
sewerage and solid wastes services in urban areas.
Water Resources
2.02        Turkey enjoys abundant aggregate water resources, but there are
some regions where water shortages are prevalent throughout the year, and
others where seasonal shortages occur. Water resources are estimated at about
200 billion m3/year including surface water that flows out of the country. At
present, withdrawals from surface water resources are estimated at about 15.6
billion m3/year with about 601 used for irrigation and the rest for municipal
and industrial use. Water abstraction from aquifers is regulated through
drilling licenses, but surface water intakes are not licensed. There are no
abstraction fees for groundwater or surface water usage.
Sector Institutions in Central Govornment
2.03        In the Central Government, the responsibility for water and waste
is dispersed among six different entities. The entities are:
9     the State Planning Organization, responsible for reviewing and
approving investment plans in the sector;
9     the State Hydraulic Works (DSI) under the Ministry of Public Works
and Settlements, responsible for national water resource
management, major water source development and operation, and
water supply to cities with population more than 100,000, except
for some of the largest municipalities (para. 2.08);
O     the Iller Bank (Bank of the Provinces), carries out water supply
development for small cities, and for major sewerage development
in all urban areas, except for some major cities;
O     the General Directorate of Rural Services (OD S) under the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Village Affairs, responsible
for rural water supply programs;
O     the Ministry of Health, responsible for the control of water
sources, and the quality of water supplied to consumers; and
O     the Ministry of Environment, responsible for controlling the
implementation of environmental legislation.

2.04        Water pollution is an acute problem in urban and industrial zones
around Istanbul, Iszit, Izmir, Ankara, Bursa, and the touristlc areas of the
southwest Kediterranean. There is a growing concern to better protect surface
water resources. Since a major part of groundwater reserves has already been
exploited future supply would have to come lncreasingly from surface water,
especially for major cities. Current solid and hazardous waste disposal
practices are also creating serious environmental problems. In view of the
problems, both the Government and the municipalities ar6 beginning to take a
much more aggressive stance toward environmental protection. Adoption of the
Environmental Law (No. 2872 of 1983), which seeks to protect and optimize use
of land and natural resources, prevent air, water, and land degradation, and
protect health, biological diversity, and cultural property was a watershed.
Regulations governing air quality and noise (1986), marine pollution (1987),
and water pollution (1988) have been promulgated. According to the law,
polluters must cover costs associated with pollution abatement and prevention,
and are responsible for all damage. Another signal of the Government's
growing commitment to environmental protection was the decision to upgrade the
General Directorate of the Environment (GDE) to the level of Kinistry. The
ODE was established in 1984 to oversee implemuentation of the Environment Law,
and to manage the National Pollution Prevention Fund (PPF).
2.05        The basic legislation required to control waste discharges in
sewers, watercourses, and landfill sites is in place. Under the Water
Pollution regulations, national water quality objectives for inland waters
have been defined in 1991 with four classes of water quality * class I for
high quality water suitable for water supply, recreation and fisheries, class
II for fairly polluted water suitable for irrigation and other uses after
appropriate treatment, class III for polluted water suitable for industries
other than food and textiles, and class IV for bighly polluted water having no
beneficial end use. The implementation of regulations designed to protect the
environment are generally the responsibility of the municipalities and
provincial governments. The municipalities capability to effectively
implemant the regulations has to be progressively developed. The most
important role in onforcing regulations regarding the protection of water
resources in metropolitan areas has been given to the municipal water and
sewerage authorities (paras. 2.08 and 5.02). The water authorities have made
progress in preparing source inventories for industrial effluent and are
levying penalties or threatening firms with closure unless they meet standards
and invest in on-site treatment. The water authorities in Istanbul, Ankara
and Izmir have all launched ambitious programs to improve sewage collection,
treatment and disposal, assisted through Bank loans and cofinancing. The
water authorities still need to strengthen their monitoring capability and
improve inspection and enforcement procedures.
Service Coveragp
2.06        Service coverage levels for municipal water in Turkey as indicated
in Table 2.1 appear high but the quality of the services received by the
population is often poor. Water pressure drops and cutoffs of service are
frequent because of source and dlstribution limitations. Average water



4
consumption (77 liters/capita/day) i8 low compared to developing countries in
Europe (about 200 lcd). The number of employees per thousand connections
(4.3) is high compared to developing countries in Burope, but low compared to
most developing countries (5 to 6). Few systems have adequate interception of
sewage or any treatment. Industrial pollution is also of concern, especially
when industrial liquid effluents are discharged in environmentally sensitive
areas such as coastlines. Domestic solid waste is often disposed in open dump
sites, where garbage is left uncovered; and industrial and clinical solid
wastes are generally disposed with poor regard to the environment or the
public safety. The lack or deficiency of water and sanitation services is
reflected in a high incidence of waterborne diseases, especially among
children in low income groups.

Sector Operating Agencies
2.07        There are at present two types of entities providing services in
the sector. In major metropolitan areas, the services are provided by



5
autonomous municipally-owned water and sewerage authorities. In other parts
of the country, the services are generally provided by water and sewerage
departments within the municipal administrations, which are also responsible
for carrying out a variety of other functions such as solid waste management,
urban transportation and gas services.
2.08        Tho municipal water and sewerage authorities have a short history.
The first one was the Istanbul Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (ISKI),
created in 1981 as an autonomous entity responsible for the planning, design,
construction, and operation and maintenance of all water supply and sewerage
facilities in Greater Istanbul. This was intended to strengthen the sector
organization, and to enable an increasing share of the sector's investment to
be financed with internally generated funds. Of particular significance,
ISKI's law gave the Kunicipal Council the right to set water tariffs and
sewerage charges without having to seek prior approval by the Central
Government, as in the past. Also, legislation enacted in 1981 defining
Greater Municipal Areas enabled entities like ISKI to take over the water
supply and sewerage services of smaller municipalities nearby the metropolitan
area. In the case of Istanbul, 24 water supply organizations were merged into
ISKI. ISKI's experience was successful, and subsequent laws authorized the
establishment of water and sewerage authorities in another seven metropolitan
areas (Izair, Ankara, Adana, Bursa, Gazantiep, Kaiseri and Konya), which with
Istanbul represent an aggregate population of 15 million or 27X of the total
population. These are also the areas of more rapid population growth in the
country.
2.09        The autonomous water authorities have not only substantially
increased the intatrnal generation of funds in the sector but also have been
able to obtain long term credits for sector development. Istanbul and Ankara
water authorities, for example, financed with internal generation of funds
about 50X of their substantial investment programs in 1990 and 1991.
Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir water authorities have received Bank loans, and
bilateral credits from several countries, among them Germany and Kuwait. In
contrast, the services provided directly by the municipal departments
generally cover no more than the cash operating expenses, and are unable to
obtain long-term capital from sources other than DSI and Iller Bank.
2.10        Although the instittitional framework provided by the legislation
governing the water authorlties represents a substantial improvement over the
previous framework (departments of a municipality), it is still not fully
adequate to satisfactorily meet the challenge faced by sector authorities in
the 1990's (para. 2.16). Political influence still plays a role not only in
major policy decisions, but also in the entities day-to-day operations; and a
centralized personnel regime is not fully consistent with the flexibility
required for an entrepreneurial activity. The water authorities' staffing
plan and the remuneration levels have to be approved by the Central Government
(iinistry of Interior), with the resulting delays in decisions and
insufficient consideration of the specific circumstances of the authority.
Further improvements in the institutional arrangements would have to be
gradually implemented taking into account the lessons learned from the
experiences of existing authorities (par"s. 2.19 thru 2.21).

Sector Investment
2.11       Turkey invested substantial amounts in water supply during the
80's, and continued increasing the level of investments in sewerage. Total
water and sewerage investments (Central Government and Water Authorities)
during 1980-89 are estimated at over US$4 billion (at 1990 prices). Sector
investments in the last four years of the decade represented about 0.7S of the
country's GNP, which is high by international standards (0.52). This
relatively high level of investments is consistent with the improvements in
service coverage (para. 2.06), but it is clear that some inmestments were
relatively inefficient as a result of inadequacies in project selection
criteria, in project execution (para. 2.14), and in the subsequent operation
and maintenance of the infrastructure.
2.12       The bulk (80 to 902) of the sector investments were carried out by
the Central Government through Iller Bank, DSI, and GDRS. The other 10 to 201
was carried out by the municipal water and sewerage companies. The breakdown
of the Central Government investments in water and sewerage, respectively, and
by executing agency is shown below and in Annex 2.1.

Sector Financing
2.13       The sector investment financing policy has been changing in a
positive direction since the early 80's. The Central Government policy until
that time was to finance virtually all investments through the Iller Bank,
DSI, and GDRS. In recent years, however, the Government has virtually stopped
financing investments in metropolitan areas (paras. 2.08 and 2.09) and thus
has encouraged the mobilization of financial resources at a local level. This
was a much needed change in policy as the Government-financed sector
investments reprasented a heavy fiscal burden (between 1.82 and 4.12 of annual
Government expenditures during 1980-89, or between 7.52 and 22.82 of annual
investments during the same period).
2.14       The Government policies under which Iller Bank, DSI and GDRS
operate, also contribute to allocative and technical inefficiencies in the
investments. First, the financing is heavily subsidized as the interest rates
charged to the municipalities are highly negative in real terms. Second, a
generalized practice of over-programing and over-contracting works in
response to political pressures result in slowdown, stopping, and restarting



7
of works after periods of inactivity because of insufficiency of funds. And,
third, water supply systems are frequently designed for excessively high per
caplta consumption levels and excessively long design periods.
Private Sector Involvemnt
2.15        Private sector involvement in the provision of the services has
been limited. One municipal water authority (BUSKI) has recently contracted
the billing of service charges and the reading of water meters. Another
authority (ISKI) established a wholly owned subsidiary under the commercial
cods for handling billing and collection. To date no leasing, concession,
management contract, or other form of contracting for a complete water or
sewerage system has been implemented.
Sector Objectives
2.16        The objectives of the sector authorities are to take the necessary
actions to: (a) promptly serve with safe water about four million of the
country's population that in 1989 had no access to piped water; (b) more than
eight million that had no adequate sewerage or other adequate wastewater
disposal facilities; and (c) most of the population that had no sewage
treatment facilities for their communities. It is also necessary to serve
about 12 million additional inhabitants by the year 2000. It is estimated
that municipal water production will have to Increase to 9.0 billion m3/year
by the year 2000 (compared to 4.0 billion u3/year in 1989), and that
corresponding increases in water treatment and distribution facilities will be
needed together with proportionately greater increases in sewerage, sewage
treatment and disposal facilities. In addition, the quality of the services
has to be improved. To address the above objectives, the capital cost of new
and upgraded urban water, sewerage, and sewage treatment and disposal
facilities during the 1990's could be approximately US$9.0 billion equivalent
(in 1990 prices). Over half of the ten-year total investment should take
place in the country's major cities (Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir and Bursa).
Previous World Bank Inwolvement in the Sector
2.17        The Bank initiated operations in the sector in Turkey 20 years ago
(1972) with a US$37 million loan for the Istanbul Water Supply Project. It
has continued its operations through 6 more loans to: the Istanbul Water
Authority; Ankara and Izmir water authorities; and a loan to small
municipalities in the Cukurova Region. Four of the projects are still under
execution. The loans amount to US$695 million.
2.18        The Bank's participation in the sector has been an important
factor in encouraging the Government to establish municipal water authorities,
including BUSKI, which greatly diminish central and municipal Governments'
financial support and involvement in the sector and establishes the framework
for quasi commercial operating entities. The Bank has also played an
important role in assisting the water authorities during the initial stages of
their operations. The Bank-financed projects have been generally successful
in meeting the physical targets (Table 2.3), and in encouraging much needed
investments in sewerage services. The concept of full cost recovery for



8
services provided progressive efficieney  improvements in the entities
operation and gradual institutional strengthonlng are clearly evident in all
of these metropolitan authorities. In stark contrast, the Cukurova Urban
Development Project had to be scaled down as a result of overambitious
objectives and poor performance on the part of Iller Bank as the Project
Executing Agency. Lessons learned from the previous projects are the need for
better institutional development, technical assistance for project management,
less optimistic projections of water sales and implementation schedules, full
political commitment to tariff increases, timely availability of detailed
designs, and better audit of the authority's financial accounts. The proposed
project takes into account the above lessons.

Bank's Role and Strategy in the Sector
2.19        The Bank's role in the sector in Turkey is to assist the
Government in its efforts aiming at: (i) improving the standards of living of
the population, particularly low-income, by the provision of adequate water
and sanitation infrastructure; (ii) alleviating the environmental degradation
from sewage, and from domestic and industrial wastes; (iii) increasing urban
productivity (health, industry, tourism, commerce) by providing adequate
infrastructure to support economic activities; and (iv) reducing sector
reliance on the central and municipal budgets.
2.20        The Bank's strategy to assist the Government efforts includes two
dimensions. First, continue supporting the development of the newly created
water authorities so as to enable them to provide adequate services at
affordable prices. The satisfactory development of these authorities should
have significant direct benefits for a substantial share of the Turkish
population (Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir and Bursa account for 20X of the country's
population, and 351 of the urban population) in areas of rapid population
growth. Also, the indirect benefits of the strategy should be significant
because the new water authorities will provide other areas of the country with
examples of successful institutional arrangements ad operational practices,
and will develop a core of highly qualified personnel which will act as agents
of change in the sector. Lending for the proposed project is fully consistent
with the Bank's role and strategy in the sector.  In particular, the
institutional development component under the project takes into account the
experience of previous projects.
2.21        The second dimension addresses the needs of smaller
municipalities. Given the severe budgetary constraints in Turkey it is
already clear that the needs of these areas cannot be met through budgetary
support, and a local capacity for significant resource mobilization and
project implementation and operation must be developed. This capacity is
constrained by a range of national and legislative issues including:
identification of an appropriate role for Iller Bank, with transparent
performance and financial arrangements, adopting revised municipal finance
legislation to promote greater municipal finance mobilization, and
strengthening the financial and technical capacity of the municipalities to
enable them to effectively provide necessary local services with the
appropriate involvement of the private sector. As became clear during the
attempted implementation of the Cukurova project, this is a massive agenda
which can only be developed in stages. Accordingly, the Bank is now working
in one Region, the Southwest Coast, to try to establish a realistic basis for
priority investments. The Bank is also preparing a Sector Review which will
sumarize these issues and their implications for the Government and mobilize
greater support in Turkey than has been possible to date to continue the
necessary policy and institutional reforms. Since this process can only be
achieved over the long term, we believe that the 'two-track' strategy
developed is both constructive in its direct benefits and catalytic for
sectoral reforms.

III. PROJECT ARA. SECTOR SUDviCES A=D DEMOND
Project Area
3.01        The project area, the area of the Greater Municipality of Bursa
and surrounding districts, is in the Bursa Province of Turkey. The city is
located approximately 20 km from the southern coast of the Sea of Narmara and
below the north-vest slopes of the Uludag Massif which rises steeply to a
height of over 2500 m. Between the city and the sea, the plain of Bursa falls
gradually from a level of 250 m in the city to the north where the level is
about 150 m. The River Nilufer, the main watercourse of the Project area,
flows along the northern boundary of the city and eventually discharges into
the Sea of Marmara. Other streams within the city boundaries are seasonal.
The city and the plain have a climate influenced by the Sea of Marmara, with
warm and dry summers and relatively mild but wet winters. Average annual
temperature is 14.4 °C and average precipitation is 703 am. Precipitation
increases with elevation and at the Uludag weather station the average
precipitation is 1531mm.
3.02        At the last official census in 1990, the population of Greater
Bursa was recorded to be about 840,000 with an average annual growth of 5.52
between 1985 to 1990. It is the fifth most populated city in Turkey, but the
first in terms of population growth rate. There has been a significant influx
of refugees from Bulgaria in recent years (unofficial estimate of 135,000).
Future growth is expected to be according to the pattern shown in Table 3.1.

3.03        The population lives in three sub-municipalities of Yildirim (372),
Osmangazi (572), and Nilufer (62). Population densities range from 150/ha in
the outlying residential districts to over 500 persons/ha in the central aree.
In the settlements close to the industrial areas, north of the city, there is a
wide range in the density of population. The development of the city is planned
to spread in three directions: along the roads to Mudanya to the north-west,
Izmir to the west and Ankara to the east. Prime agricultural land in the north-
east has been declared as a *green belt area, not for urban development, but
there has been some illegal development difficult to control.



11
3.04        The city is a large industrial center for the region, with about 51X
of the working population employed in the industrial sector and 472 in the
services. In addition to established industries based on agriculture and
textiles, the city has attracted new industries such as vehicle manufacture (901
of all cars made in Turkey), machinery production and food processing. The city
is also a tourist attraction because of: (i) its rich historical past being the
first capital of the ottoman Empire; (ii) Its natural hot springs, and; (iii)
its winter sports facilities on the Uludag Massif which is the best equipped in
Turkey. In 1989, total bed capacity reached 9,000. Income distribution varies
according to the areas, with Osmangazi sub-municipality baving the highest
proportion of low- income households. In 1990, 23X of the total households in
the city were classified as low-income, having an annual income below US$5,700
equivalent.
Water Supply - Existing Facilities. Level of Services. Future Demand
3.05        Bursa's present water supply is from springs (151), groundwater
wells (191) and surface water (661 from Doganci dam) (Table 3.3). The springs
emerging from the north-facing foothills of Uludag generally provide clear and
clean water which needs only chlorination. However, during the rainy seasons,
turbidity is observed in some of the springs and simple additional treatment is
then required. The springs are an indispensable resource for the districts at
high elevation. Groundwater is extracted by two groups of wells, one group of
11 wells in the Arabeyatagi field provides about 470 1/s, and an other group of
11 wells in the Acemler field provides about 600 1/s. After chlorination
groundwater is pumped either to reservoirs at high elevation or directly into
the distribution network. Some industries in the Bursa Plain have their own
wells corresponding to 114 issued permits and a total potential yield of
530 1/s.
3.06        Surface water gravity fed from the Doganci Dam, located 15 km south-
west of Bursa on the Nilufer River, is treated in the Dobruca Treatment Plant.
Treatment consists of aeration through cascades, pre-chlorination, coagulation,
rapid sand filtration and post-chlorination. The first stage of the plant was
designed for a capacity of 250,000 m3/day but limitations in the transmission
lines and other distribution facilities limit its contribution to 150,000 to
195,000 m3/day. A second stage of treatment works, under construction with DSI
financing, would bring the total capacity of the treatment plant to 500,000
m3/day in 1993. DSI plans to construct a second dam upstream of Doganci Dam and
needed by 2000 (Annex 3.1).
3.07        The water distribution system is divided into four zones according
to different elevation range. In 1991 the system included about 800 km of
pipelines, 45 reservoirs with a total capacity of 300,000 m9, 156,000
connections fully metered and 990 public fountains. It is estimated that only
901 of the population is served. Total water produced per capita served was
about 303 liters/capita/day (lcd), which is a satisfactory level, but total
billing (domestic and non-domestic) averaged only 115 lcd. Water not billed
comprises water being provided free (61 of production) for certain public use
(public fountain, parks, mosques) and substantial water unaccounted-for (561 of
production) due to important water leakages (preliminary estimate of 50X of
production) and non-physical losses (illegal connections, mains flushing).



12
Present information on the ratio between physical and non-physical losses is not
reliable. Water supplied free for public use is generally not metered (Annex
5.2, Attachment 3, para. 3D). Total water billed per capita served is in line
with urban areas in Turkey (100 to 120 lcd) and in other middle-income
countries, but low compared to developed countries in Europe (about 200 lcd).
Taking into account water consumed but not billed (free water, illegal
connections, under metering), total water (domestic and non-domestic use)
actually consumed per capita served in Bursa is estimated at about 160 lcd.
Domest 3 water consumed and water sold were respectively about 98 and 90 lcd.
3.08        It is expected that water leakages would be reduced from 50X in 1990
to 401 in 2000 because of the program for reduction of unaccounted-for water
proposed under the project. Domestic water sold is expected to increase very
moderately from 90 lcd in 1990 to 108 lcd in 2000. Estimation of future
required water production capacity (Table 3.2) was based on population growth,
domestic water demand per capita, an increase from today's 901 of population
served to 951 by 2000, and increases of institutional, commercial and industrial
water demand in proportion to land developments. This projection has been used
in sizing the water supply and sewerage components of the proposed project.

3.09        The future gross water demand is expected to be met through
renovation of the springs, further development of the two existing well fields
and development of two new well fields (Acemler and Samanli), the gradual
increase of the water withdrawn from the Doganci dam due to the completion of
the second phase of the treatment plant, and the construction of the second
Doganci dam. The minimum capacity of the sources required to supply the future
demand is in Table 3.3, and a chart of source capacity compared to water demand
is in Annex 3.1. To meet the increased demand up to 2000, the required
investments in water production facilities are limited, but the required
investments in water distribution are substantial.

Sewerage - Uisting Facilities. Level of Servies, Future Demand
3.10        Bursa is served by an existing combined sanitary and storm sewerage
system mainly in the sub-municipalities of Yildirim and Osmangazi. There is
virtually no sewerage network in the Nilufer sub-municipality. The total length
of the collection network is about 450 km. It is estimated that 70X of the
population is connected, but about 60X of the connections to the existing system
were constructed illegally and, in many instances, very poorly, causing blockage
of the sewers. There are no sewage pumping stations. All sewage is discharged
either to septic tanks or flows by gravity and untreated to the nearest ravine,
gully or watercourse. Septic tanks are emtied by BUSKI which applies a
sewerage surcharge on water billed even if the house has no sewer comnection.
Households preferring a quicker service are charged TL 10,000 to 50,000 by
private contractors. Waste collected from septic tanks is discharged straight
to the existing sewerage system or to a nearby creek. Industries also discharge
an average of 40,000 i/day of effluent with a load of 32 tonne/day of
Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and 67 tonne/day of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)
into the nearest watercourse without any treatment. Such discharges result in
gross pollution of the Nilufer River and, downstream of the city, of the surface
and ground water resources used by farmers for their domestic and agricultural
needs, including the irrigation of food products sold in Bursa' s markets. Waste
water discharges contribute also to the pollution of the Sea of Marmara in the
vicinity of the mouth of this river. The project includes provisions to control
industrial pollution through a mix of regulatory and economic instruments (para.
3.14).
3.11        The 1983 master plan for sewerage of the city proposed a separation
program involving the construction of a new system for sanitary sewage only and
the conversion of the existing combined system into a storm drainage system.
Iller Bank contracted for the construction of the first phase of works of a
separate sewerage system. To date 50X of the works have been completed and
ongoing works are expected to be completed by 1994. The next phase of the
sewerage works and the conversion of the existing combined system into a
stormwater system are included under the proposed project.
3.12        In the future, the percentages of households, institutions/commerce
and industries connected are expected to vary over time according to their
locations in the city as shown in Table 3.4.

consideration the connections rates to the water supply system. The required
treatment capacity, in terms of flow, is in Table 3.5.

3.14        Based on a pollution discharge of 55 gr/capita/day of Biological
Oxygen Demand (BOD), plus an appropriate allowance for BOD discharge from
industries, the total BOD load would reach 169 tonne/day for 2020. It has been
assumed that the general mix of industries will remain approximately the same.
The large proportion of textile related industry suggests that this is a valid
assumption. An allowance for pretreatment at industrial sites was made.
Regarding BOD, it has been conservatively assumed that pretreatment at
industrial sites would provide an abatement of 201 of the BOD load. The metals
and cyanide are not in concentrations likely to inhibit municipal sewage
treatment. An immediate construction of a cyanide and metals processing plant
is not required. However, if the incidence of cyanide increases as more
industries are attracted, there may be a time when such a plant becomes
necessary.



15
3.15        Just downstream the city. the Nilufer Rlver conta4ns, on average for
the whole year, 1.7 mg/l of Dissolved Oxygen and 64 mg/l of SOD, which indicates
a very high pollution corresponding to class IV (para. 2.05). In order to
prevent public health risks and odor within the environs of the city, protect
groundwater sources for water supply, allow downstream water use by industry and
agriculture, and lessen the level of pollution in the Sea of Marmara, the water
quality of the Nilufer River down stream of the city should be in class II.
During preparation of the project an analysis of the assimilative capacity of
the river has been carried out using a simulation model of river water quality.
The model was calibrated with the analyses carried out periodically by DSI. The
analysis showed that the dilution effect of the wastewater effluent in the river
is low, and hence its assimilative capacity. Accordingly, It would be necessary
to achieve a high standard of effluent discharge from the wastewater treatment
facilities. The simulations run on the water quality model indicated that the
class II objective requires a very high degree of treatment which would be only
affordable in the long term. Intermediate objectives should be to reduce gross
pollution in the short term and a class III standard for the medium term. These
could be obtained from a staged investment consisting of an anaerobic pond
treatment as a first stage, followed by an activated sludge treatment in a
second stage.
IndusL ial Wtewater Managmen_
3.16        BUSKI is responsible for monitoring and controlling industrial
liquid waste discharges within Bursa according to the BUSKI establishment law
(para. 5.02), and the national environmental law (para. 2.04). BUSKI's
management has yet to develop the institutional capability to effectively
implement the legal provisions aiming at controlling and abating industrial
water pollution. Water pollution control has relied primarily on regulatory
instruments (standards, permits, licenses, and land use control), and less on
economic instruments such as charges for wastewater disposal. The institutional
capability to enforce compliance with the regulations will be strengthened
through the project institutional development component. BUSKI will implement a
new tariff structure which will provide the industrial finrs with incentives to
control pollution (para. 6.04).
Solid Waste Management - Existing Facilities. Level of Services. Future Demand
3.17        Although practically all areas are served, solid waste management is
a growing problem in Bursa. Domestic refuse and commercial refuse is collected
by collector/compactor vehicles of between 2 to 6.2 tomes capacity which carry
the waste directly to an open dump. The collection of waste is difficult
because of the narrow streets in the city; this necessitates the use of small
collection vehicles which are inappropriate for travel to any landfill site
situated a great distance away. The amount of waste generated in winter is
about twice that generated in sumer because of the presence of ashes (70X by
weight) due to the use of wood and lignite as fuel for heating. House holders
are required to place their refuse and their ashes into separate plastic bags
for separate collection, but they generally dispose of refuse and ash together.
The amount of waste generated by person increased from 258 kg in 1986 to 315 kg
in 1990. Existing regulations do not allow municipalities to recover directly
solid waste management costs from households.



16
3.18        The open dump is located north of the city, very near (3.5 km) the
city center. In 1990, about 268,000 tonnes of waste were collected. The
current landfill started to be used 20 years ago and now occupies an area of
about 10 ha and Is about 10 to 17 m deep. Waste accumulated over time amounts
to about 1,500,000 m9. Operation is inadequate since there is no regular
covering of wastes with earth or similar material, no waste compaction and no
significant slopes to shed rainwater from the site. The site is generally
malodorous because of lack of covering material and smoke generated by the
presence of fires. Although the nature of geological formations underlying the
site creates potential for leachate and landfill gas migration, there is no
monitoring and control of leachate, landfill gas migration, surface and
groundwater contamination. The landfill is gradually using up and sterilizing
valuable agricultural land. The remaining area available for tipping is about
one hectare, which would accommodate not more than 150,000 mP of refuse, i.e.
less than one year of refuse disposal. Existing heights are not to be exceeded.
Scavengers live on the site sorting out waste for recycling tins, paper,
plastics and glass. Scavenging is sanctioned by the Municipality which receives
an annual payment from the scavengers. Taking into account population growth,
decreasing amount of ashes disposed per capita because of the planned
introduction of natural gas in Bursa, and a slight increase of other refuse
generated per capita because of improved standard of living, the expected growth
of domestic and commercial solid waste generation is estimated as shown in Table
3.6.

Industrial Waste
3.19        Information regarding the quantities and types of industrial waste
generated in Bursa is not comprehensive. However, as a result of a survey
carried out for the preparation of the proposed project, it was found that: (i)
industrial wastes generated in Bursa vary between 9,000 and 20,500 tonnes/year;
(ii) chemical, petroleum, man made textile, automotive and leather industries
are the major hazardous waste producers; and (iii) hazardous industrial waste
consists mainly of low flash point solvents, pesticides, chromium sludge and
persistent chlorinated substances such as PCB. Currently, there are no
incentives for industry to store and treat waste materials or dispose them



17
appropriately. Th. practlce is generally to discharge most liquids in the
severs and to have solid waste removed by local haulage contractors. There is
no control over the local contractors and wastes are gonerally deposited in the
nearest dumps. Industrial wastes need clearly to be appropriately managed
through a system of control, the development of enforceable regulation adequate
storage, provision of a separate collection system and the establishment of
treatment and disposal facilities (para. 4.07).
Clinial Waste
3.20        Taking into account a recent survey and international statistics, it
is estimated that between 5 to 10 tonnes/day of clinical wastes are generated in
Bursa. Clinical wastes are generally not segregated from other wastes. The bulk
of the clinical wastes are landfilled. Incinerators exist in the Kunicipality
Veterinary Department and the two main hospitals.  However, the low temperature
incineration in the hospitals does not provide a fully adequate system of
disposal. It is estimated that health care expansion will generate an
additional 2.0 tonnes/day by the year 1995. Improving clinical waste management
in Bursa requires: (i) the establishment of a code of practice for developing
standards for segregation, handling and storage, management system,
transportation and disposal; (ii) containerization of clinical waste; (Lit) the
creation of a separate collection service, and; (iv) the establishment of a
centralized clinical waste incineration facility (pars. 4.07).

4.01        After Bursa had become a metropolitan municipality, Bursa Water and
Sewerage Directorate (BUSKI) was formally established on January 1, 1988 and
started to function effectively in October 1989. A pre-feasibility study
regarding sewerage, water supply and solid waste management for the metropolitan
area was commissioned to a joint venture of UK and local consulting firms in
November 1989 and completed in February 1990. At the Government's request the
Bank agreed to include a Bursa Water and sanitation Project In the Bank lending
program. In March 1991, the Bank sent a mission to Bursa to asslst ln taking the
steps necessary for the preparation of feasibility studies. In July, 1991
contracts were signed for carrying out the feasibility studies, and at the end
of March 1992, the final reports were issued. Following strengthening of the
Project managemen4 Unit and selection of consultants for detailed design, the
Bank sent an appraisal mission in June 1992.
Prgoiect Obiectives
4.02        The main objectives of the proposed project are:
(a)   to improve envlronment conditions and reduce health hazards ln
Greater Bursa caused by: (L) inadequate collection, and lack of
treatment of municipal and industrial sewage; (ii) seasonal flooding
ln some areas because of poor storm water drainage; (iii) inadequate
domestic solld waste disposal, and lack of hazardous solid waste
management;
(b) to improve the institutional arrangements regarding the management
of municipal water supply, sever services, and of domestic and
hazardous solid wastes;
(c)  to meet the demand for water supply, sewerage, flood protection and
solid waste services, including the demand fron the poor living on
the fringes of the city;
(d)   to postpone the need to develop new water resources by Lproving the
efficiency of water usage by reducing the volume of non-revenue
water whLeh is presently too high (631); and,
(e) to implement appropriate cost recovery policies.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
4.03        The Bank has collaborated successfully with the municipal authority
of Istanbul for water supply and sewerage projects (Loans 844-TU and 2159-TU),
and is presently assisting water supply and sewerage authorities in Istanbul,
Ankara, and Izmir. Bank Lnvolvement In the sector has been generally successful
in meeting the physical targets for the projects, and in encouragxag the



19
Government to establish municipal water companies, including the recently
created (1989) BUSKI. In particular, the semi-nutonomous status of the Water
S-pply and Sewerage Authorities of these large cities, established with 8ank
support, provides a valid institutional model for Bursa. This approach
maximizes the self-financing effort of the utilities, their sense of ownership
and responsibility, their autonomy, their efficiency, and results in a rapid
diminution, in each of these cities, of the role of Central Government agencies
such as Iller Bank and DSI which remain encumbered with a wide range of
financial, management and institutional problems.
404         Continued Bank support to the sector is required on several
accounts. First, to ensure that the newly created water companies enjoy
adequate support to develop their managerial, technical and financial
capabilities to levels which allow them to provide adequate services at economic
costs and affordable prices. The experience in Turkey shows that this is a
major undertaking and that the Bank is in a position to provide the necessary
incentives for the much needed institutional development. The proposed project,
building on the experience of previous projects, contains a major institutional
develcpment component. Second, the Bank in its country assistance strategy has
agreed with the Government on the need to support projects which protect the
environment, promote sustainable use of natural resources, and strengthen local
institutions' capacity to achieve these objectives. Because of its emphasis on
critical environmental issues, sustainability of municipal institutions and
urban health and poverty issues, this project was accorded highest priority by
the Government and the Bank. Third, the project provides an example of how the
national water quality objectives can be progressively reached (para. 3.15)
Lithin the framework of the National Water Pollution Regulations (para 2.05).
Proiect Deseription
4.05        The project has two distinct parts with two different borrowers: the
water supply, sewerage and storm water part with BUSKI as borrower, and the
solid waste part with Bursa Metropolitan Municipality as borrower. However, the
same Project Management Unit would assist in implementing the two parts.
Water Su=lv. Sewerage and Storm Water Part
4.06        The water supply, sewerage and storm water part is described In
detail in Annex 4.1 and indicated on IBRD Maps Nos. 24150, 51, and 52. This
part of the project includes the following major components:
(a)  water supply works and equipment needed to:
(i) renovate existinag nriLgs to improve their production capacity.
The total capacity of the existing springs is estimated to be 19.7
Nm/y when they are all functioning efficiently. At present, for a
number of reasons, their yield is only 12.7 MnP/y. The springs
should be restored at the earliest possible time because they are
located at high levels and their use reduces power consumption. A
total 35 km of new pipelines will be laid on the mountain side.



20
(ii) rehabilitate existing distribution networks; each year for the
next three years, about 3.5Z of the most unsatisfactory sections of
the existing network (totaling 1000 km of pipes) will be replaced;
the sections will mainly be selected after examination of the
records of burst pipes;
(iii) increase the _roduction of well fields by about 32 million
m9/year through the construction of 10 new wells and improve pumping
stations through the installation of three new pumping groups;
(iv) construct a 30,000 m3 capacity distribution reservoir to
provide the storage capacity required for the increased water
demand;
(v) construct main Dioelines totaling 70 km to extend the supply to
new distribution networks and improve the supply in the existing
networks; and extend existing ditrbuton ne rksa to supply new
consumers in new areas covering 810 ha;
(b)   sewerage works and equipment needed to:
(i) extend the collection networks by constructing: new collectors
totaling 5.4 km and collection networks to serve 140 ha in the
industrial sector North of the city; new networks covering 660 ha in
areas to be served by existing collectors, the existing networks
having to be converted into stormwater drainage networks; and, new
sewer connections in the above mentioned areas covering 660 ha;
(ii) treat and disnose sewage flows collected by the sewerage
networks. The Project includes two phases of construction of a
wastewater treatment plant located East of the city and serving the
central and eastern area and another plant located West of the city
and serving the western part of the city and its industrial zone.
The first phase works consists of pre-treatment works and anaerobic
ponds of 134,000 m3/day and 46,000 m?/day capacity. The use of
anaerobic ponds will result in the removal of all visible solids,
reduce the Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) by about 30X in winter up
to 701 in summer and reduce the faecal coliform pollution by about
501 in winter to 93Z in summer. The project also includes the 2nd
phase of construction of the works in the Eastern and Western
Plants. The second phase works will make use of the pre-treatment
facilities constructed in the first phase and add secondary
treatment (para. 4.16) of 161,000 m3/day and 74,000 m3/day capacity
and sludge treatment facilities. This would result in an effluent
standard of 20 mg/l BOD and 30 mg/l suspended solids. The systems
will be designed to accommodate the addition of units to achieve a
higher standard up to full nitrification at a later stage, if
necessary. Both of the plants would be equipped with heated
anaerobic digesters for surplus sludge (para. 4.16).
(c)   storm water drainage works and equipment needed to:



21
(i) rehabilitate the existipt networks covering 4,582 ha;
rehabilitation will consist in completing the network, replacing
damaged pipes, constructing proper catch pits and manholes, and
cleaning the pipes;
(ii) construct open channel interceutors KI, K2, and K3 of total
length 9 km in the Southern part of the city to avoid clogging of
the storm water drainage collection system;
(ii) extend the collection system; this would involve the supply
and laying of 14.2 km of collectors and the construction of networks
in new areas covering about 337 ha;
(d)   consulting services for:
(i) technical assistance in groject implementation for:
(1) detailed design and construction supervision for the above
water supply, sewerage and drainage works;
(2) survey and investigations needed for proper mapping of the
water supply and sewerage systems; and,
(3) staffing of a Project Nanagement Unit to assist BUSKI in
coordinating the part activities, supervising the consultants,
and preparing the periodical reporting requested by the Bank.
(ii) technical assistance in institutional development. This will
include:
(1) a twining    ngmuent with a reputable water supply and
sewerage operator in order to assist BUSKI in implementing an
Action Plan consisting in: (a) designing and implementing a
training program for BUSKI's managers and statf; (b) designing
and implementing a program to increase the volume of water
billed as a proportion of water produced (reducing physical
and non-physical water losses and water given free of charge);
(c) designing and implementing an Asset and Capital Investment
Mbnagement System, which includes appropriate procedures for:
establishing investment priorities; making effective and
efficient use of existing assets; monitoring and controlling
investment programs; and ensuring the renewal of assets; (d)
designing and implementing a Management Information System,
which provides adequate information on BUSKI's operational and
financial performance; (e) designing and implementing a new
water and sewerage tariff schedule aiming at promoting water
conservation, controlling water pollution, and ensuring
BUSKI's financial viability; and
(2) consulting services to studv the-feasIbility of a
contractual arrangement  after bidding. with a nRlvate firm
for partial or full operation of Bursa water supply and



22
sewerage systems in order to enhance competition, efficiency,
accountability and commercial practices in the provision of
water and sewerage services.
Solid Waste Part
4.07        The solid waste part of the project Is described In detail in Annex
4.2 and indicated on IBRD Nap No. 21150. This part of the project includes the
following major components:
(a) civil works and equlpment needed to:
(i) rehabilitate the existing dump site; this would include control
of areas where wastes are on fire, diversion of a stream,
construction of a bund, control of leachate, regrading and planting,
construction of a collection ditch and venting of landfill gas;
(ii) develop a new landfill site of 10 ha in Hamilter Valley X; this
would include construction of a 2.5 km long access road, site
excavation and clearing, clay and geomembrane spreading, sub and
surface drainage, separate areas for disposal of industrial waste,
construction of a small building for office and maintenance,
Installation of a weighbridge and supply of earth moving equipment;
(iii) construct a 600 tonnes/day waste transfer station with two
covered tipping halls two weighbridges, one mobile grab, one loader
and two slave tractors;
(iv) provide collection vehicles for municipal waste (18 rear-load
vehicles and 6 bulk semi-trailors) and industrial waste (two skip
vehicles, and 80 containers);
(v) provide facilities to install two clinical waste incinerators
(0.5 tonne/hour unit capacity) in a location to be selected, and two
20 as box vans for collection; only one incinerator will be
installed under the project;
(b)   consulting services for
(i) techni¢al assistance in protect i,nlementation for:
(1) detailed design and construction supervision of the above
solid waste management works;
(2) detailed design for the next phase of development of the
new landfill site; and,
(3) contribution in staffing of a Project Management Unit to
assist the Municipality in coordinating the project part
activities, supervisLang the consultants, and preparing the
periodical reporting requested by the Bank.



23
(ii) technical assistance in institutional development for
strengthening the municipal organixational arrangements for the
management of solid waste, through the implementation of an astigz
El=n (Annex 5.3) aiming at: (i) increasing the transparency of the
municipal solid waste service in terms of financing sources and
costs; (ii) exposing the service to open competition; and (iii)
making the service more accountable and responsive to the citizen
needs.
The Technical assistance will assist the municipality in
implementing the Action Plan which includes: (a) the creation of a
regulatory body within the Metropolitan Municipality to oversee and
enforce environmental laws and regulations relating to the safe and
proper disposal of solid and liquid wastes, and other environmental
matters; (b) the creation of a municipal operational corporation
responsible for providing services for the management of household
waste collections, clinical waste collections, industrial waste
collections, and landfill site operations; and (c) the contracting
out of at least part of the collection service.
ect Costs
4.08         The combined cost of the two parts is estimated at US$258.4
million equivalent (excluding interest during construction); US$235.4 million
for the water supply, storm drainage and sewerage part, and US$23.0 million for
the solid waste part. Detailed project cost estimates are given in Annex 4.3 and

Project Implomentation
4.12       The Project will be managed by a Project Management Unit (PHU)
headed by a high level expert already hired since the beginning of the
implementation of the feasibility studies. The PEU Director is experienced in
Project Management and with Bank's procedures and guidelines. The unit was
recently reinforced by a qualified engineer and a qualified financial
professional. The role of these specialists will be to assist BUSKI's and BMM's
management in following up progress made in implementing the measures required
for the entity's operational and financial improvement, and to recommend
specific actions to achieve the targets. During negotiations BUSKI and BMW
agreed-to maintain an exnerienced PMG Director and two specialists In the
groiect management unit. The PHW will be assisted in BUSKI by the Planning and
Investment Department which is planning and mAnaging directly BUSKI's routine
investments and in the Solie Waste Department of the Municipality by the New
Works Division. These Departments have never implemented large investments and
they would not be able to attract qualified experts because of the low level of
salary offered by the institutions.
4.13       For the water and sewerage part, BUSKI has requested its consulting
consortium which carried out the feasibility studies, to carry out the following
additional urgent engineering studies financed under the PPF: (a) specification
of a survey for digitisation of existing maps, topographic survey of development
not covered by existing maps, preparation of base maps, and underground asset
survey; (b) survey, geotechnical investigations, design concept, performance
specification and bid documents for the pre-treatment and anaerobic ponds of the
Eastern and Western Sewage Plants; (c) topograp.iic survey, flow measurement,
water quality sampling and preparation of technical specifications related to
the civil works contracts for Spring Source Improvements.
4.14       For the solid waste part, the Munlicipality has placed two small
engineering contracts, financed under the PPF, to: (a) prepare bidding documents
based on detailed design for the civil works contract of the new Landfill site
(Hamilter Valley X) and conceptual design of the whole Hmilter Valley; and (b)
land surveying and detailed design of an access road (para. 7.15) to Hamilter
Valley.



26
4.15        Detailed design for the lumpy works (sewage pre-treatment, anaerobic
ponds and large collectors have been completed under the on-going engineering
studies (para. 4.13). Further detailed design, including detailed Investigation
and survey, provision of assistance In evaluation of bids for supply of goods
and civil works, and construction supervision will be carried out in two phases,
one for the works to be implemented over the next two years, the second for the
remaining works of the project. For the first phase detailed design of the
water and sewerage part, a Consortium of Consulting Engineers has been selected
by BUSKI.
4.16        The detailed design of the activated sludge treatment facilities
will be finalized only after commissioning of the anareobic ponds and review of
the precise characteristics of the wastewater collected from the newly connected
residential, commercial and industrial areas. The detailed design of the sludge
treatment facilities will be finalized only after review of the sharacteristics
of the sludge collected from the activated sludge facilities.
4.17        The Terms of Reference for technical assistance and training through
twinning     gement contract are outlined in the Action Plans shown in Annexes
5.2 and 5.4. Proposal evaluation and award of contract for technical assistance
will be carried out by the PUl and reviewed by the Bank (pars 4.24).  In
addition to the responsibilities for overall project management and
coordination, the PEU will have the responsibility for monitoring project cost,
preparing withdrawal applicatlons for Loan disbursements, and teporting on
project implementation.
4.18        The project would be implemented from early 1993 to end 2000. The
implementation schedules and program of expenditures are in Annex 4.5, page 1
for the water and sewerage part and page 2 for the solid waste part. The project
completion date is set at December 31, 2000. The extended project
implementation schedules take into account delays which may lntervene during
implementation. The programs of expenditures follow the Bank's standard
disbursement profile for the sector in Turkey. However, the Action Plans
formally agreed at negotiations with BUSKI and the Municipality are based on
more rapid Implementation schedules and program of expenditures in order to
mobilize in time the counterpart funds required.
Land Acquisition
4.19        The site recomn _ded by the consultants for the Western waste
treatment plant covers 37 ha, including provision of 10 ha for future sludge
lagoons. A total of 12 ha consists of 24 smell lots privately owned, and a total
of 25 ha consists of three large lots owned by the municipality. Only ten
privately owned lots totalling 4 ha are required for the construction of the
first phase of the treatment works. The site for the Eastern treatment plant
covers 52 ha, includlag provision of 20 ha for future sludge lagoons. It
consists of four large lots privately owned. Only one lot will be used for the
construction of the first phase treatment works. The two sites are within the
boundaries of the Greater Municipality. The formalities for the acquisition for
the two sites are proceeding satisfactorily and have almost been completed
during project preparation. Engineering Consultants have already bored test
boreholes for the required investigations.



27
4.20        The sanitary landfill recommended by the consultants requires 90 ha
for its total development. The site needed to be acquired for the first phase
development (Valley X) totals 17 ba. The site consists of 110 small lots
privately owned and within the boundaries of the Greater Municipality.  The
Assembly of municipalities has decided positively on the site selection. Funds
for compensation to the private owners have been fully deposited. The
formalities for the site acquisition are practically completed and the
Consultant has carried out test boreholes and detailed design of the new
landfill.
4.21        For all the sites, the land is agricultural and uninhabited. The
procedures to acquire the 120 private lots needed for the project implementation
and to compensate the owners entail the approval of the Ministry of Agriculture
and of the Metropolitan Assembly which include representatives of the private
owners in affected areas, the valuation of the lots by a Value Assessment
Committee, and the possibility for each lot owner to challenge the
implementation of the acquisition procedure in a court within one month after
notification of the acquisition. The 120 private owners include about 110 small
farmers and involve about 800 people. Only one owner challenged in court the
acquisition process. In December 1992, the Court refused stoppage of the
acquisition process. Because of the Court's ruling, the borrowers can start the
construction works. The land acquisition procedures are fair and consistent with
normal Turkish practice. Acquisition is proceeding satisfactorily and has not
given rise to difficulties in on-going operations.
Procurement
4.22        Table 4.4 below summarizes the elemnts of the two parts of the
project, their estimated costs and proposed methods of procurement. An
estimated US$143.4 million equivalent of civil works would be procured through
international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the World Bank
Guid2linea. An estimated US$18.1 million equivalent of small civil works and
spreadout contracts which often involve mainly earthworks are not considered to
be of interest to foreign contractors. They would be procured through local
competitive bidding (LCB). All contracts for Works would be for construction
only, except the contracts for sewage treatment which would be for design and
build. An estimated US$48.5 million equivalent of goods would be procured
through ICB. All contracts and their estimated value are listed in Annex 4.3
and 4.4. They would be all procured on ICB or LCB, except for water and
sewerage maintenance equipment for readily available off-the-shelf goods that
are small in value (contracts not to exceed US$150,000 equivalent) would be
procured through international shopping (comparison of price quotations obtained
from at least three suppliers from different countries). The aggregate value of
the contracts to be placed through international shopping shall not exceed
US$1.2 million equivalent. Some retroactive financing for engineering services
and construction of civil works in amounts up to US$1.2 million for BMM and
US$3.0 million for BUSKI may be required. They would include the most urgent
works needed to be carried out: access road to the new landfill (LCD), new
landfill (ICB), and anaerobic ponds (ICB).

A Country Procurement Assessment Report was completed in 1988. lowever, in the
context of this project, the borrowers would use Sample Bidding Documents for
procurement under ICB, currently under preparation by the Bank and Turkish
authorities, and derived from the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents. For
procurement under LCB, the municipality would follow the State Adjudication
Law No 2886 used throughout Turkey and BUSKI would use its own procedure,
which is the same as Ankara Water and Sewerage Authority's procedure and
follows very closely Laws No 2886 and No 2990. These local procedures are
acceptable to the Bank provided that the aix clauses indicated in Annex 4.8
are reflected in the bidding documents.
4.24        To encourage prompt action on the part of the borrowers, the
consulting firms for provision of technical assistance re8arding institutional
development would have to be selected by XBUSKI and the Mumlclpality as a
condition of Loan Effectiveness.
4.25        For all contracts procured through ICB, each contract regarding
procurement of goods estimated to cost more than $500,000 and for each
contract for works estimated to cost more than $1,000,000, the procurement
documents would be subject to the Bank's prior review. Major procurement
problems are not expected since the Project Manager is familiar with Bank's
procurement procedures and pre-agreed Standard Bidding Documents would be
used. Contracts for lesser amount would be fully documented and subject to
ex-post review. These limits would result in prior review of contracts
representing about 95X of the procurement total amount to be financed by the
proposed loans. Consultants for detailed design, construction supervision,



30
and technical assistance are being/would be engaged in accordance with the
Wogld Ant Gudelines fgr the Uxe of Consutan. Civil works contracts for
construction of anaerobic ponds (US$17.1 million) and secondary sewage
treatment plants (US$47 million) are expected to be won by joint ventures of
foreign and local firms. Other civil works contracts are expected to be won
by local contractors who, in recent years, have been extremely competitive in
Turkey. Contracts likely to be won by foreign manufacturers are the supply of
distribution pipes (US$38.4 million), the supply of Water and Sewerage
Maintenance Equipment under ICB (US$1.8 million), and the supply of equipment
for collection, and transfer of solid waste, and incineration of clinical
waste (US$9.5 million). Qualifyi=; local manufacturers would receive a
preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent of the CIF price or the prevailing
Import duty, whichever is less. Procurement information will be included in
periodical progress implementation reports to be submitted by the Borrowers
(para. 4.31).
4.26        Consulting contracts for project implementation (6 contracts)
would total US$18.0 million and require about 1,200 man-months of experts.
Consulting contracts for institutional development (4 contracts) would total
US$10.2 million and require about 600 man-months of experts. The cost break-
downs are given in Annex 4.3 and 4.4. The nature of services are summarized
in paras. 4.06 d and 4.07 b, detailed in Annex 4.1 D and Annex 4.2 F. The
Technical Assistance for institutional development is further detailed in
Annexes 5.2 and 5.4. The contracts are expected to be won by foreign
consultants in joint venture with local consultants.
Loan Diab=M2=met
4.27        Disbursements from the proposed loans would be made for:
(a)   civil works: 47 X of expenditures for the Loan to BUSKI and 48X of
expenditures for the Loan to the Municipality;
(b)   goods: 47 Z of expenditures for the Loan to BUSKI and 48X of
expenditures for the Loan to the BNN and,
(c)   100 I for techni- ' assistance.
4.28        To have, for each loan, the same disburs_ment percentage for civil
works and goods categories would ensure a balanced implementation of the
project. This would avoid any risk that equipment (usually financed at 10O2
by the Bank) might be procured too far in advance of the corresponding civil
works (usually financed at a far lower percentage than equipment). For the
equipment to be procured under this project, the borrowers will buy on the
foreign exchange market the currencies needed to complement the Bank
financing. This reflects the fact that currency is freely convertible in
Turkey and is expected to continue to be so.
4.29        A Special Account would be opened for BUSKI and another one for
the Municipality in a comercial bank or in the Central Bank with an initial
deposit of US$6 million for BUSKI and US$1.0 million for the Municipality



31
(approximately four months of estimated disbursements at the peak period of
disbursements).
4.30        The proposed allocation of the proceeds from the loans is shown in
A=nne 4.6. The estimated schedules of disbursements are given in Annex 4.7.
The schedules are consistent with the Banks historical disbursement profile
for the sector in Turkey. The Closing date of the loa0n would be June 30,
2001.

and the EMM agreed that they would submit a Project CoflMltion Zort to the
Bank siX months after the closing dates of the Loans.
Smpenrigigm Plan
4.32        Two Bank supervision mission per year during nine years of
Implementation would be required to adequately rsview implementation of the
project. More extensive supervision would be required during the first three
years of the project during which time the technical assistance would be made
operational and many procurement contracts would be tendered, evaluated and
awarded. Istimated staff-weeks per year for supervision would be about 18 in
years one through three and 14 during years four to nine. Each mission should
include one sanitary engineer and one financial analyst.

V.               An  M g==
5.01        The borrower and executing agency for the water supply and
sewerage component of the proposed project would be the Bursa Water and
Sewerage Authority (BUSKI). For the solid waste mnagement and disposal
component, the borrower and executing agency would be Bursa Metropolitan
Municipality (8MM).
5.02        BUSKI was created by Law No.3305 of 1989, as a municipal
enterprise. Under the law, BUSKI is responsible for the development and
operation of all public water supply, sewerage, and storm drainage servicos
for Bursa metropolitan area. It is also responsible for monitoring and
controlling liquid waste discharges, as well as for enforcing water pollution
control regulations.
BUSKI's Institutional Frnmework
5.03        BUSKI was created in the context of the Government's
decentralization program, which has been supported by the Bank. BUSKI's
institutional arrangement is a replica of the one previously implemented in
other metropolitan areas (Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, and Adana), which has
resulted in improved sector operations and financial performance (paras. 2.07
through 2.10).
BUSKI's Governing Entities
5.04        BUSKI's law grants to the Ministry of Interior and to the Council
and the Mayor of Bursa the decision-making powers regarding most of the
entity's policies and operations. The remaining have been granted to BUSKI's
own governing entities, which are made up of representatives of the Ministry,
and the Council and the Mayor of Bursa.
5.05        BUSKI is governed by:
O     a General Assembly, consisting of the Metropolitan Municipal
Council;
o     a Board of Directors, consisting of the Mayor of Metropolitan
Bursa (Board's Chairman); the entity's General Director (Board's
Vice-Chairman); the Assistant General Director; and three full-
time members appointed by the Ministry of Interior upon request
from Bursa's Mayor. All Board members, with the exception of the
Chairman, should have at least ten years of experience in the
public sector; and
O     BUSKI's General Director who is the chief executive officer
responsible for day-to-day operations, and is appointed by the
IYinistry of Interior upon nomination by the Mayor.



33
5.06        The General Assembly approves BUSKI's investment plans and
operating budgets, tariffs, and borrowing. The staffing proposals to be
submitted to the Ministry of Interior (para. 5.09) are also approved by the
General Assembly. The General Assembly meets twice a year, in Kay and
November.
5.07        The Board of Directors approves the entity's operating principles
and regulations; oversees their implementation by the General Director;
reviews and approves matters to be submitted to the General Assembly for its
approval; and appoints senior officials and staff other than the General
Director and Assistant Directors.
5.08        The General Director, supported by an Assistant General Director
and four Assistant Directors, implements the decisions made by the General
Assembly and the Board of Directors, and conducts the entity's day-to-day
activities.  The four Assistant Directors are: one for water supply operations
and customer services; one for sewerage and mechanical and electrical
maintenance; one for fLnance and administration; and one for plannlng and
construction (Annex 5.1).
EUSKI' sStaffing
5.09        BUSKI's staffing plan, remuneration levels, and personnel
regulations are approved by the Ministry of Interior. The staff falls under
three categories: salaried, contractual and workers. Some staff are subject
to the regulations under Law 657 on civil servants, while others fall under
the general Labor Law 1475, whlch applies equally to public and private
enterprises.
5.10        BUSKI's 880 employees include 10 management and senior advisory
staff; 60 engineers and technicians; 100 accounting and co_mercial operations
staff; 100 other office workers; and 610 skllled and semi-skilled service and
maintenance workers. The total number of employees gives a ratio of
approximately 4.9 employees per 1000 water connections, which is high by the
standards in Western Europe (3.5) for utilities providing similar services,
but not by the standards of Turkey and of most developing countries (5 to 6).
Staff turnover is low (2 to S% per year).
AUSKI's Managexial Cagabilities
5.11        BUSKI's top management team is made up of personnel with
substantial experience in the running of the water supply and sewerage
services in Bursa. The team maintains a tight and effective control of the
activities of the organizatlon, in accordance with traditional practlces and
procedures. However, the members of the team have little or no exposure to
the institutional arrangements, and the managerial and operational practices
of more developed and efficient utilities, particularly outside Turkey.
Neither the management team nor the staff has experience in the operation and
maintenance of sewage treatment facilities.
5.12        This lack of exposure, together with the lack of training, slows
down BUSKI progress in raising the quality of the services and the efficiency



34
of the operations closer to state-of-the-art standards. BUSKI's less than
satisfactory performance in the three major areas below is largely a
reflection of those shortcomings, as well as of policies not adequately
grounded on technical criteria:
0     water commercialization -- only 381 of the estimated water
production is billed to BUSKI's customers, as the bulk (62Z) of
the production is lost in the transmission and distribution
systems, or used by the customers without charge because of
inadequate consumption metering (i.e. poorly calibrated meters;
non-metered connections; and lack of control of meter readers --
para. 5.13); and because of the policy of non-charging some
consumers (para. 6.03);
O     infrastructure operation and maintenance -- while significant
aspects of the operation and maintenance are satisfactory (for
example, the response time for emergency repairs and for
installing new connections), there are important operational
aspects which are not fully satisfactory and result in significant
inefficiencies and in low service quality. In particular, the
virtual absence of planned infrastructure rehabilitation,
upgrading and replacement, contributes to the high water losses
and to reduce the useful life of the existing infrastructure; and
o    financial controls -- the entity's compliance with budgetary
requirements, and the management of its short-term cash position
are adequate. However, the accounting system, the cost controls,
and the medium- and long-term financial planning are not yet fully
adequate (paras. 5.15 through 5.18).
BUSKI's Billing And Collection
5.13        Since May 1992 BUSKI's sales are metered and billed every month by
private contractors, and the experience is providing satisfactory results.
The privatized meter reading has substantially improved BUSKI's efforts at
detecting and replacing faulty meters, and at detecting and regularizing
illegal connections and improper user categorization. This has resulted in an
increase in water sales but the full impact of the privatized metering and
billing system has yet to be assessed on the basis of the 1993 results
(para. 6.13).
5.14        Bill collection from residential, commercial, and industrial
customers is generally satisfactory and is being further improved. Collection
from municipal and central government agencies is, however, a problem as they
often pay at the end of the year without any penalty or interest for late
payment, with the subsequent losses for BUSKI because of inflation (government
entities account for about 6% of the volume billed and 14X of the value
billed). The total collection index (amounts collected/amounts billed during
the year) has been as follows: 1989: 84X; 1990: 951; and 1991: 86%. As a
satisfactory bill collection performance is essential for BUSKI's financial
viability, the project contains provisions to adequately monitor this aspect
of the entity's operations (para. 6.12).



35
BUM's PlaMing and Information System
5.15        BUSKI's financial and investment planning is virtually limited to
the preparation of the annual budget to be submitted to the entity's General
Assembly in November of each year (para. 5.06). One of the results of this
short-term planning horizon and of the almost exclusive emphasis in ensuring
compliance with legal budgetary requirements, is that the entity's investments
often are inadequately planned and funded, with the inevitable result of
substantial delays in completing works in progress. In addition, there is no
systematic planning for renewing and upgrading existing assets (para. 5.12).
5.16        BUSKI's information systems for both managing the entlty's
operational and commercial activities, and for reporting on the overall
financial results (financial accounting systems) have yet to be substantially
improved. Information regarding operations is collected and stored by the
managers of the different administrative and operational units, but it is of
limited value as: (i) there is no system in place for systematically
disseminating it or for assessing its implications over the entity's overall
results; (ii) there are no standards or targets with which to compare it; and
(iii) there are no systematic cost records and reports of current activities
or investment projects.
5.17        BUSKI's accounting system is basically a cash accounting system
not suited for a commercial entity like BUSKI, as it is not based on generally
accepted accounting principles for commercial enterprises. Important
deficiencies in the accounts include:
o     lack of distinction between capital and recurrent costs;
O     lack of distinction between interest and principal payments;
O     lack of breakdown of accounts receivable by age;
O     incomplete record of liabilities originated in DSI and Iller Bank
financed projects;
O     incomplete and unreliable records of fixed assets, including those
built by Iller Bank and DSI; and
O     lack of accounting for inflation.
5.18        BUSKI'-s predominantly manual information and accounting systems
make it difficult to maintain up-to-date records and to provide adequate
information to the entity's management. BUSKI is aware of this limitation and
recently contracted the services of a consulting firm which is assisting lt on
computerizing and updating some records related to customer billings, accounts
receivable and payable, payroll, inventories, and control of budget execution.
This is an important initiative which will be continued and expanded under
project (paras. 5.21 and 5.22).

BUSKI's External Audit
5.19       The preparation of the proposed project included the audit of
BUSKI's 1991 financial statements by private auditors acceptable to the Bank.
The auditors issued a disclaimer of opinion on the financial statements
because of the substantial weaknesses of BUSKI's accounting system
(paras. 5.16 and 5.17). The improvement of the accounting system is part of
the project (para. 5.21). In addition, agreement was reached during
negotiations that BUSMI will have its financial statements including DroJ ect
accounts audited by grivate external auditors acceptable to the Bank. and
under terms ofL reference also acceptable to the Bank. The Special Account
will be audited by the Sworn-in BAuk Auditors (auditors entitled to audit
banks in Turkey). The audit renorts should be submitted to the Bank no later
than June 30 each year.
BUSKI's Training Programs
5.20       BUSKI has yet to put in place a training program and a special
budget to that effect, as present training for BUSKI's staff consists almost
exclusively of on-the-job learning from more senior staff. This practice of
learning from practitioners of the existing methods results in the self-
perpetuation of those methods and in a strong resistance to change. The
proposed project includes a training component (para. 4.06 d and 5.21).
Action Plan to Strengthen BUSKI's Performance
5.21       The proposed project emphasizes technical assistance and
investments aiming at improving BUSKI's managerial, operational and financial
performance (para. 4.06). To ensure that the technical assistance is properly
and timely executed and that the expected benefits of the project investments
are realized, the project includes a detailed Action Plan and timetable for
the improvement of BUSKI's performance. The Action Plan (Annex 5.2) includes
the following:
(a)  BUSKI's operational and financial projections for the years 1993-
2000;
(b)  a program for training BUSKI's management team and staff;
(c)  a program for the reduction of unaccounted-for water;
(d)  a program for the implementation of a system for: (i) establishing
investment priorities; (ii) making effective and efficient use of
existing assets; (iii) monltoring and controlling the investment
programs; and (iv) planning for future asset renewals (Asset and
Capital Investment Management System);
(e)  a program for the implementation of an operational information
system, a comercial accounting system, and an updated budgetary
system consistent with the entity's legal and operational
requirements (Recording Nanagement and Information System);



37
(f) a program for the impleamentation of a new tariff system: and
(g) a feasibility study of the contracting with the private sector a
part or the full operation of Bursa water supply and sewerage
systems.
5.22        The Action Plan will be carried out by BUSKI with the assistance
of a reputable water supply and sewerage operator under a twinning
arrangement. The provision of the technical assistance by only one firm is
important to ensure an appropriate coordination of all the elements of the
Plan which are closely interrelated.  Agreement was reached during
negotiations on the Action Plan and timetable for its imolementation. The
selection of consultants throushI tinning arrangsments is a condition of Loan
Effectiveness (parU. 4.24).
5.23        Durnng negptiatlons.    8ssuauCe were obtained from BUSKI that
progress toward liplementing the Action Plan and achieving the targets will be
discussed annuallv between the Bank and BUSKI. The discussions will take
place before September 30 of each year starting in 1993, and would include a
review of: (a) progress made; and (b) BUSKI's proposed update of the Action
Plan. If any of these reviews shows an unsatisfactory performance or update
of the Action Plan, BUSKI should submit to the Bank a satisfactory alternative
not later than November 30 of the same year. The financial projections
updates will in particular Indicate any tariff increases in real terms -- i.e.
over and above the quarterly adjustment (para. 6.01) -- needed to be
implemented to enable the entity to generate sufficient revenues to finance
the capital expenditures in the Action Plan.
Role of the Private Sector
5.24        BUSKI's Board and management are determined to increase private
sector participation in the provision of water and sewerage services. So far
they have gained experience with the awarding of two important contracts:
meter reading and billing; and meter repair and installation. The experience
is proving satisfactory (para. 5.13) and BUSKI's Board and management are
willing to further explore the possibility of contracting with a private firm
the operation of the whole water and sewerage system. The proposed project
includes technical assistance for conducting the feasibility study for the
necessary contractual arrangements (para. 4.06 d). The terms of reference and
timetable for the study are included in the Action Plan for improving BUSKI's
performance (para. 5.21 and Annex 5.2).
5.25        The preparation of the proposed project included steps toward
further familiarizing Bursa and BUSKI's authorities with best sector practices
abroad. A group with representatives of Bursa munlcipal authorities and of
BUSKI's Board visited France and the U.K. to familiarize themselves with the
sector institutional arrangements and practices in those countries, with
special emphasis on competitive private sector participation. Also, the
consulting team assisting BUSKI in preparing the project included personnel
with experience both in carrying out feasibillty studies, and in managing and
operating highly developed water utilities.

MUl  METOPOLITAN MICIPALI
5.26        The Bursa Metropolitan Municipality (BMM), was established in
March 1988, and includes three District Municipalities: Yildirim, Osmangazi,
and Nilufer (para. 3.03). The respective duties and responsibilities of the
Metropolitan Municipality (3M0) and of the District Municipalities (DM) are
outlined in the Metropolitan Municipalities Law (Law 3030 of 1984). Under the
law, the BMM is responsible for refuse disposal, and the District
Municipalities for refuse collection and transport to the place indicated by
the BNM.
Organizational Aarragkment for Solid paste Manag2mant
5.27        The solid waste management service in Bursa is presently provided
under the umbrella of the Metropolitan Municipality's Solid Waste Division,
which coordinates all the activities related to solid waste collection and
disposal in the Metropolitan Area. The DMa individually own the vehicle
fleet, and employ the collection workers (480 in the DMa and 220 in the
Metropolitan Municipality). Although the 21 collection vehicles have no major
faults, they are not Inspected and serviced regularly. Also, each DM keeps
Its own stock of spare parts, and orders new parts when it considers these are
necessary. There are no adequate information systems and cost controls. This
arrangement has resulted in a highly inefficient waste collection service run
largely in a management vacuum.
5.28        The Municipal authorities are aware of the inefficiencies of the
system and will undertake under the project a major restructuring of the
organizational arrangements for solid waste management. The restructuring
includes three main elements. First, the creation of a municipal entity with
responsibility for regulating and controlling all solid waste related
activities in the Metropolitan Area; second, the creation of an autonomous
municipal corporation mainly responsible for the management of the landfill
site operations, the industrial and clinical waste disposal (paras. 3.17 and
3.18), and household waste collection not contracted by the DMs with private
firms; and third, the contracting out of part of the household waste
collection services with private firms selected by the DMs through competitive
bidding. It is envisaged that the municipal corporation will be eligible to
compete for contracts for household waste collection.
5.29        The first pilot contract with a private firm for household waste
collection was awarded in 1992 by one of the DMs (Yildlrim) and other
contracts are to be bid shortly within the context of the project. Seventy
thousand inhabitants or 20X of Yildirim population is being served under this
contract (Annex 5.3 contains details of the contract).  The selection of the
contractor was done through competitive bidding. The results have been
encouraging in terms of both the quality and cost of the services. Personnel
costs have been substantially reduced through higher labor productivity (25
workers at present working one shift vis-a-vis 32 before with substantial
overtime) and lower personnel remunerations (TLl.5 million month/employee vis-
a/vis 8 aillion month/employee). The redundant personnel has been assigned to
other functions in the municipality or reduced by attrition.



39
5.30        The proposed project includes technical assistance to the
Municipality for further implementtng the reform, and for training personnel
for the regulatory entity and for the autonomous municipal authority (para.
4.07 b). To ensure that the reorganization is properly and promptly carried
out, agreement was reached during nagotiations on an Action Plan and timetable
to this egffct. The Action Plan (Annex 5.4) includes:
O     actions and timetable for creating and setting-up a mwnicipal
regulatory body, which would be the first of its klnd in Turkey,
to regulate the private collectors of waste and the municipal
solid waste corporation;
O     actions and timetable for creating and setting-up the municipal
operating corporation which would be responsible mainly for the
separate collectlon of clinical and industrial waste, and the
operation of the transfer station and the landfill;
O     actions and timetable for fur her contracting out household
collection services; and
o     training for personnel of the regulatory body and of the
operational corporation.
5.31        Rurig neggtLations- aenent was obtained fom  BMK that Mroress
toward imlementing the Action Plan would be discussed pQriodically between
the Bank and the Mhnicipality. The dLcussions would take place in September
of each year and will include a review of: (a) progress made; and (b) the
Municipality's proposed update of the Action Plan. If any of the reviews
hows an unsatisfactory performance, and agreement is not reached on the
updated Action Plan, the Municipality should submit to the Bank a satisfactory
alternative not later than November 30 of the same year.
kxternal Audit
5.32        Agrement was obtained during neggtiations that the Municipality
will have the uroisct aseounts for the solid waste comnonent and the Siecial
Aecount audite by auditors aecegtable to the Bank. BMK will submit to the
Bank the audit reports not later than June 30 each year.

VI. ZMmO
BUSKI's Cost Reeovery Methods
6.01        BUSKI applies three basic cost recovery methods: (i) tariffs for
water and sewerage services, based on water consumption levels and type of
customer; (ii) cbarges to direct beneficiaries of investments in construction
and rehabilitation of secondary water and sewerage networks; and (iii)
connection fees, penalties and charges for repair and maintenance services.
BUSKI' s General Assembly recently approved a system of quarterly tariff
adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index to compensate for the inflation
of the past quarter. During negotiations. BUSKI agxeead to maintain this
system of automatic guarterly adiustment.
6.02        Water and sewerage tariffs as implemented on January 1, 1993 are
equivalent to an average of about US$0.70/ms at the mid-January average
exchange rate (about TL 8800 per US$). The tariffs schedule is as follows:
Table 6.1:  BUSKI Water and Sewerg  Tariffs (VAT not inluded)
Tvne of Customer                                Tariff
(TL/m3)
Residential
up to 10m/month                                 3,750
more than lOm3/month                             7,620
Business, industry, public agencies                   11,600
Neighboring municipalities and university             2,899 to 3,410
Industrial Zone                                       5,627
6.03        The water and sewerage tariffs apply equally to customers in the
first two categories (residential, and business, industry and public agencies)
receiving water services only and customers receiving both water and sewerage
services. Sewerage is charged as a surcharge on water tariffs -- 10 at
present.  All customers face minimum monthly charges to cover BUSKI's fixed
commercial and administrative costs. Significant subsidization is provided to
residential customers by busines, industrial and public customers, with the
greatest benefit going to lower quantity (up to 10 m9 per month), mainly low
income consumers. Water consumption through public fountains (about 980) and
public baths (12) are not metered and not subject to charge (estimated
consumption amounts to about 61 of production). Also, water for parks, fire
fighting and street cleaning is not subject to charge. Users of groundwater



41
through private wells are not being charged for discharging the effluent in
the sever system.
6.04        By law, beneficiaries of investments in construction and
rehabilitation of secondary water and sewer networks are charged for the cost
of these works. In practice, those charges are negligible as they are not
adjusted for inflation and are not subject to interest charges during the
construction period or during the repayment period. The cost recovery method
for these investments is stipulated in the Municipal Revenues Law (No. 2464 of
May 1981).
6.05        BUSKI's cost recovery methods would be reviewed and revised as
necessary during project execution with a view to: (i) ensuring that they
better reflect the economic and financial costs of servicing different types
of customers; and (ii) incorporating adequate charges for the use of the
upgraded sewerage system, including the sewage treatment plants. To this
effect, the Action Plan (para. 5.21) would include the preparation of a
detailed tariff study based on marginal costs, and also aiming at providing
incentives for water pollution control and abatement, particularly by industry
(para. 3.16). The study should be undertaken by BUSKI with the help of
qualified consultants, and be completed by April, 1994. The results of the
study should be discussed with the Bank, and agreement reached on a set of
recommendations to be implemented by BUSKI starting in July, 1994.
BUSKI's Evolution of Tariff Levels
6.06        BUSKI's tariff levels in 1991 and 1992 were on average about
US$0.50/mi sold while other operating revenues amounted to the equivalent of
about US$0.06/mi sold. Tariff increases implemented during the second
semester of 1992 and in January 1993 have increased the tariff levels to about
US$0.70 m3 sold, and other revenues to about US$0.07 m9 sold, for a total
operating revenue of about US$0.77 m3 sold. The January 1993 tariff and other
revenues level represent an increase of about 38£ over the average for 1991
and 1992.
BUSKI's Past Finsncial Performance and CurXent Financial Position
6.07        Water and sewerage investments in Bursa have been traditionally
financed by loans from DSI and Iller Bank, under highly concessionary terms
(para. 2.11).  Thus, BUSKI initiated operations in 1989 with a substantial
asset base (estimated at about US$200 million) and a relatively small lira-
denominated debt with DSI (US$8 million equivalent). This comfortable
financial position has been maintained, as BUSKI's management has contracted
new long-term debts only with DSI and Iller Bank, and has prudently managed
the entity's liquidity position. At the end of each one of the years 1989-91,
the entity's cash availability has been in the order of US$4 million, and the
interest earned on bank deposits has amounted to about US$1 million a year.
Annex 6.1 presents a summary of BUSKI'S cash flows for 1989-91.
6.08        On the cash receipt side, the cash flow statements show:



42
O    a sustained growth of cash receipts originated from the entity's
own operations (including value added tax receipts and interest
earned but excluding the shares from the national tax revenues)
from US$8.2 million equivalent in 1989, to US$12.7 million in
1990, and US$18.3 million in 1991;
O     relatively Important cash receipts (US$1.1 million in 1989 and
US$1.6 and US$1.6 million in 1990, and US$2.0 1991) from shares of
the national tax revenue.
6.09       On the cash payments side, the cash flow statements show:
o     a significant increase in payments to personnel, because of
increrse In the salary level and the commissionlng of a treatment
plant, both in absolute terms (from US$1.3 million in 1989 to
US$2.2 million In 1990 and US$8.6 million in 1991), and in
relation to total cash payments (from about 18X of total cash
payments in 1989 and 1990 to 46X in 1991); and
o     investment expenditures, maintenance and repairs to the network
(these categories are not separated in the accounts) fluctuating
with cash availability (1989: US$3.5 million; 1990: US$7.0
illion; and 1991: US$6.7 million).
BUSCI's Future Finances and Sub-Project Financing Plan
6.10       BUSKI's financial requirements during the coming years have been
analyzed taking into account two alternative scenarios for project execution.
The first is based on the standard profile for loan disbursements in the
sector in Turkey (Annex 6.2), while the second, the Action Plan (Annex 5.2,
Attachment 8), is based on a more rapid project Implementation and loan
disbursement schedule.
6.11       Under the Action Plan, Bursa authorities and BUSKI's management
will implement operational and financial policies and practices which enable
the entity to generate enough cash for:
O     Improving the quality of the services and of the infrastructure
operation and maintenance practices;
O     internally generating funds to finance the local counterpart funds
required for the project; and
o     servicing for the first time a debt in foreign currency (the Bank
proposead loan) at a near-commercial interest rate.
6.12       Nore specifically, BUSKI's total operating revenues should
gradually increase from about US$21 million preliminarily estimated for 1992;
to about US$33 million in 1993; US$47 million in 1994; and US$86 million in
2000 (all at current prices). The actions to be taken to generate the
required revenues and to contain costs include the following, which are
lncluded in BUSXI's Action Plan:



43
O     total water sales should be increased from 34 million m3 in 1991
to 49 million ms in 1995, and to 65 million m9 in 2000;
o     water billed, as a percentage of water produced has to gradually
increase from 38X in 1991; to 451 in 1995; and to 511 in 2000;
O     bill collection has to increase from 861 in 1991 to 93X in 1998
and thereafter; and
O     labor productivity has to increase from 4.9 employees/1000 water
connections in 1991; to 3.7 in 1995 and thereafter.
O     average tariffs and other revenues from water and sewerage
services should gradually increase from US$0.77/m3 as of January
1993 to an average of US$0.82 for the year 1993 and US$1.05 for
1994 (all in current prices). At constant 1991 prices, the levels
are: January - US$0.73; average 1993 - US$0.77; and average 1994 -
US$0.96. Required tariff and other revenues level during project
execution would stabilize at US$0.96 m3 at 1991 prices. The
required tariff level is affordable (para. 7.10) and similar to
the present tariff levels in Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir.
6.13        To safeguard BUSKI's financial soundness and to assess the
improving trend, agreement was reached during negotiations on the following:
o     not later than May 31, 1993, BUSKI should carry out and review
with the Bank an assessment of its operational and financial
performance during the January 1, 1993 through April 30, 1993
period, including inter alia, water sales and the adequacy of
tariffs and other revenues and operating costs to generate
sufficient cash revenues to finance the 1993 capital expenditures
as programmed in the Action Plan; and no later than July 1, 1993,
take all necessary measures to meet the requirements for the 1993
capital expenditures;
O     not later than September 30 of each year, starting in 1993,
discuss with the Bank within the context of the review and
updating Action Plan, the tariff increases required to enable
BUSKI to generate sufficient cash revenues to finance the capital
expenditures required for the project; and
6.14        In addition, agreement was reached during negotiations that BUSKI
shall produce starting in 1993 funds internall geneMrated for investment
during the current year. the 2revious year and the following year equivalent
to no less than 501 of the entity's capital exuenditures incurred during the
current and the previous year and the ca2ital expenditures expected to be
incurred during the following year.



44
6.15        Municipal law requires that munieipalities pay for the collection
auad disposal of domestic solid wastes from their general budgets, without
direct charges for the service. Collection and disposal of industrial solid
wastes must be paid for by the industry.
6.16        The solid waste management cash operating costs represent about
17X of the aggregate revenues of the Metropolitan Hunicipality and of the
three District Municipalities (about US$9.9 million in 1991 out of US$58
million total revenues -- US$35 million for the Metropolitan Municipality and
US$23 million for the Districts). This cost estimate, however, underestimates
the actual costs as it does not include depreciation charges and overhead
costs. Major capital costs in recent years include the acquisition of 15
vehicles in 1990, and of further 5 in 1991. Annex 6.3 contains a summary of
the 1988-91 budget execution for the Metropolitan and the District
Municipalities. The major source of revenues is Bursa's share of the
Governmont's revenues on income taxes. To a lesser extent, municipal taxes,
incomes from rents and fines are sources of revenues. Annex 6.4 contains a
breakdown of the solid waste collection costs for 1991. In 1991, the costs of
personnel ($8.73 million equivalent) represented 88X of total solid waste
expenditures.
Financin; the solid Waste Sub-urogect
6.17        Project investments will be financed with resources from the
municipalities' general revenues. Between 1993 and 2000, project investments
will amount to an average of about US$2.9 million a year in current dollars,
and the portion to be financed by the municipalities to US$1.3 million. The
total budget (current, capital expenditures and debt service) to be allocated
to solid waste operations will gradually increase from US$10 million in 1991
to US$21 million in 1999 (both figures at current prices). Most of these
expenditures are to be financed from the municipalities' general revenues,
except a part (US$0.5 to US$1.0 million) estimted to be covered by direct
charges for clinical and industrial waste disposal. Annex 6.5 contains
details of the project financial requirements and its financing.
6.18        The solid waste project component should be affordable by the
Metropolitan and District Municipalities as the total financial requirements
for solid waste management, operations, investments and debt service will be
about the 1991 level on a per-capita basis (about US$12.00 per year at 1992
prlces). This, in turn, represents about 171 of the aggregate expenditures of
the M.N. and the D.Ms. (US$67.00 per-capita in 1991). The cost containment is
the result of the increases in operational efficiency envisaged in the Action
Plan for Institutional Development (para. 5.30).

Project Benefit4
7.01        The project would have major benefits stemming from: (i) improved
operational efficiency of BUSKI and the solid wast. management of the
Municipality; (ii) promotion of local resource mobilization and cost recovery;
(iii) reduction in the health hazards to the local and tourist population
through better water supply, sewerage and solid waste management services;
(iv) reduction of losses in property and labor productivity resulting from
frequent flooding; and (v) improvement of environmental conditions through
treatment of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater, rehabilitation of the
existing dump site, and separate collection of clinical and industrial solid
wastes.
Bbnefits of Vater SuMIX and Sewera.& Part
7.02        The water supply component will provide an increased water supply
to serve the growing population of Bursa, and the growing demand of industrial
and commercial customers. Water sold is expected to increase from 33 million
m3 in 1991 to 65 million m in 2000, an increase of 97X (72X due to population
growth, 251 due to increase of domestic and non-domestic consumption per
capita). Water connections are expected to increase from 190,000 in 1991 to
293,000 in 2000. Service coverage is expected to increase from 90X in 1990 to
951 in 2000.
7.03        For the first time in Bursa, sewage would be treated.  Under the
first phase of implementation of sewage treatment, all sewage would be
intercepted and removed of all visible solids, and BOD by about 301 to 701
according to the season. Under the second phase of implementation, the sewage
effluent would have its BOD reduced to 20 ppm and its Suspended Solids reduced
to 30 ppm. The level of sewerage service would be increased from 711 in 1991
to 851 in 2000, which would involve first-time sewerage for about 79,000 new
households.
7.04        The construction of the drainage facilities will reduce the
incidence of flooding in Bursa and will constitute the first steps in
rehabilitating the drainage network in the city and the development of a
separate system.
7.05        The provision of technical assistance is expected to increase
efficiency of BUSXI. Non-revenue-water is expected to decrease from 621 in
1994 to 49X in 2000. Employees per 1000 water connections are expected to
decrease from 4.9 in 1991 to 3.8 in 2000. Better cost recovery for collection
and treatment of industrial wastewater would be obtained through the
introduction of a new tariff structure based not only on quantity discharged,
but also based on pollution load.

Benefits of Solid Waste Part
7.06        The replacement of the present open dump with a modern, controlled
landfill site will eliminate a major source of nulsance, odors, visual
intrusion, possible public health effects and leachate contamination of
aquifer and surface water resources. The elinical waste component will reduce
public health effects from uncontrolled disposal of clinical wastes. Present
practices risk the spread of Infectious diseases. The gradual eliminatior. of
uncontrolled dumping of industrial and hazardous wastes will reduce nuisances
on public health and quality of water resources.
Least Cost Solution
7.07        For the water supply and sewerage part the most economic
alternatives to meet the water demand have been selected. Rehabilitation of
existing facilities (springs, water distribution networks and storawater
networks) and reduction of unaccounted-for water have been programmed.
Optimal use of spring water followed by increasing use of groundwater wells
for water production would permit postponing the construction of a new dam
(Annex 3.1). For sewage treatment, a phase approach has been adopted and
different process alternatives have been studied and compared by analyzing
discounted capital and operation costs. The stabilization ponds alternative
and the trickling filters alternative have been considered, but discarded
because of the too large land requirements (750 ha and 215 ha respectively).
The conventional activated sludge process was found to be more economical than
the extended aeration process (oxydation ditches or similar), and to have some
environmental advantages: (a) fully stabilized suitable for direct application
to agricultural land; and (b) capability of progressive expansion to meet
progressively higher effluent standard.
7.08        The sanitary landfill disposal selected for the solid waste part
of the project is the least-cost alternative. It was compared with the
other disposal alternatives: incineration and composting. Incineration is
inappropriate due both to the low calorific value of the Bursa waste and to
the high capital costs. Composting is not recommended because of problems
in marketing the compost, relatively high capital costs and generally poor
experience. Collection and transport of waste were considered with and
without a transfer station, and It was found that the use of a transfer
station will reduce overall costs.
Rate gf Retr
7.09        The internal rate of return (IRR) of the water and sewerage part
of the project has been calculated uslng the incremental water and sewerage
revenues as a best proxy of the benefits attributable to the investments.
The average selling price which will apply in 1995, the year part of the
project is expected to be operational, (1.00 US$/l3 at 1992 price level), has
been taken in order to calculate the revenues. The use of actual price
charged as a proxy for benefits is extremely conservative since a high
proportion of consumers would be willing to pay more than this for essential
water supplies. The cost and benefit streams include the capital and
operating costs and benefits related to inveatments additional to the



47
project in order to meet the water and sewerage dmand up to 2021. All
costs are at the 1992 price level and exclude taxes. The resaltant rate of
return is 8.21 and would rang. from 2.2X to 13.72 if costs and benefits were
to be increased or decreased by 202, respectively (AnAx 7.1). The economic
rate of return would be higher if unquantifiable health, envirommental and
social benefits are included in the calculations.
A ffab1Utj
7.10       BUSKI applies differential tariffs to residential customers,
with the lowest tariff levels applied to customers consuming up to 10
mP/month. The low tariff level beLng intended to provide households with
enough water to satisfy basic needs and maintain minimum health and sanitary
conditions. The lowest tariff for water consumption and sewerage services
in January 1993 was TL3,750 (US$0.43) or TL37,500 (US$4.30) per month for
lOi5 which is the average quantity sold to a household. This amount
represents about 12 of the monthly income for the households in the top
group of the low-income category in Bursa (less than TL2,000,000 -- US$480 -
- at 1991 prices), or about 2X for the average group of this category. In
the financial projections for BUSKI's Action Plan, the average water and
sewerage tariff -- excluding other charges -- is projected to reach its
higher value in real terms by 1994 (US$O.88/is at 1991 prices). As8sming
that the tariff structure underlying the projected average would be the same
as today's structure (para. 6.01), the monthly payments for 10 is would be
about US$5.00 or 2.02 of the 1991 monthly income of the average low-incomn
household. This is higher than today's level, but well within the range of
acceptability by Bank standards (a standard often accepted in Bank projects
has been to keep water and sanitation charges under 52 of household income).
There should be no question of affordability of the projected rates to
customers in higher income groups. At present, tariff levels in Ankara,
Istanbul, and Izmir are about US$1.00 /ma which are higher than the projected
rates for Bursa.
Poverty louat
7.11       Over the 1991-2001 period, it is estimated that the water supply
component would directly benefit 116,000 addltional low incoe residents out
of 480,000 new beneficiaries, and that the sewerage component would directly
benefit to 50,000 low income residents. All the population would indirectly
benefit from the sewerage and stormwater and solid waste components becawue
of improved environmental conditions ln the city. The above figures have
been estimated by assuming that the percentage of the low income group would
remain the same (22.72) over the 1991-2001 period and that new areas to be
served would have the sam proportion of low income residents as the
existing areas. This is leading to conservative figures in terms of poverty
Impact. Although quantified evLdence is missong, it is felt that the new
areas to be served tend to have a higher proportion of low income residents.
=[omntaLl agr
7.12       The environmental components of the project amount to 702 of the
total project cost. This percentage represents the share of the sewerage,



48
sewage treatent, stormwater, and solid waste components. The project's
overall environmental impact will be very positive since it wifl (L)
postpone the need to develop new water resources; (ii) improve the water
quality of water streams and reduce contamination of groundwater and
seawater; (iii) reduce the incidence of flooding in Bursa; and, (iv) improve
solid waste collection and disposal. Environmental assessments for the
project components were carried out as part of the feasibility studies.
7.13        The project components which have specific environmental impacts
are the two sewage treatment plants, and the new solid waste disposal
landfill. For the eastern sewage treatment, seven different sites have been
considered and an environmental review of the sites has been carried out.
The site selected is presently used for mixed-agriculture (arable and
pasture) at about one kilometer from existing buildings. It would be
surrounded by the meanders of the Nilufer River, the existing dump site and
the municipal depot which form a *cordon sanitaire". There would be no need
for odor control equipment. The second best site would accommodate both
treatment plants. It was rejected because it would require significantly
longer sewers across good quality agricultural land, additional pumping with
associated energy cost and maintenance, and lack operational flexibility
since all capacity would be removed should the plant break down.
7.14        For the western sewage treatment plant, two sites were
considered and an environmental review of the sites has been carried out.
Both sites are on agricultural land and are, on the whole, similar in their
potential environmental impacts. The site selected has a higher
agricultural value, but a lesser ecological value, is better in terms of
future development, and is further from existing and planned development.
7.15        Four possible sites for the new landfill have been inspected for
environmental review. Two sites (Balat and extension to the existing dump)
have been rejected for environmental and planning reasons. The site of
Hamitler Valley X was selected because it can be developed more quickly.
Environmental control measures have been incorporated in the preliminary
design of Hamitler Valley X. A new access road to the site will be
constructed in order to avoid crossing the Hamilter Village with solid waste
loaded vehicles. Environmental control measures will be again reviewed when
the detailed design is available to the Bank. Environmental considerations
have also been taken into account in the preliminary design of the transfer
station.
7.16        The advantages and disadvantages of the different site
alternatives and the measures planned to mitigate the project environmental
impacts are summarized in Annex 7.2 for the sewerage component and Annex 7.3
for the solid waste component. During negotiations. the mitigation plans
were agreed with the Borrowers.
7.17        The technology of the proposed project is standard and involves
no unusual risks. The main risk is BUSKI's financial and institutional
capability to carry out the proposed project, as it will require substantial



49
improvementu in the entity's ability to carry out a large investment
program, to generate funds for investment, and to improve its overall
managerial and operational practlces as projected. Experience with other
municipal water and sanitation authorities in Turkey demonstrates that close
project supervision and adequate technical assistance mitigate these risks
and the project design includes a substantial technical assistance
component. Similarly, the acceptability of high and increasing tariff
levels has been clearly demonstrated in Istanbul and Ankara where high
internal cash contributions to investments are being achieved because of
insufficient availability of long term debt financing. Provisions to ensure
that the authorities promptly take the necessary actions to increase tariffs
and to improve efficiency are included in a Plan of Action agreed at
negotiations. Progress in the compliance with the Plan will be evaluated
annually. During project preparation, BUSKIs Goneral Assembly agreed to
implement a system of quarterly automatic tariff adjustments based on a
price index formula to compensate for the inflation of the past quarter.
Also during project preparation, a Project Management Unit was established
and detailed designs are available for the first two years of construction.
The need for adequate tariff and technical assistance was extensively
discussed at the mangerial and the political level (Municipal General
Assembly) during project preparation.  The fact that BUSKI will have to
finance its investment program through adequate tariff and productivity
increases is clear to BUSKI and to local and central authorities.

VIlI. CiI i5&A           L AND BKCYQnAUIONS
Agreements Reached at Nepgtiations
8.01        The following agreements were reached during Loan negotiations:
(L)    BUSKI and the BMN will maintain an experlenced Project Management
Unit Director and two specialists in the Project Management Unit
(para. 4.12);
(ii)   BUSKI will maintain a system of quarterly tariff adjustment to
compensate for inflation of the past quarter (para. 6.01).
(iii)  Not later than May 31, 1993, BUSKI will carry out and review with
the Bank an assessment of its operational and financial performance
during the January 1, 1993 through April 30, 1993 period, including
inter alia, water sales and the adequacy of tariffs and other
revenues and operating costs to generate sufficient cash revenues
to finance the 1993 capital expenditures as programmed in the
Action Plan; and no lator than July 1, 1993, take all necessary
measures to meet the requirements for the 1993 capital expenditures
(para. 6.13);
(iv)   BUSKI will carry out an action plan, with timetable, covering the
1993-2000 poriod, for the implementation of the project components
aiming at improving the entity's managerial, operational and
financial performance (paras. 5.20 to 23). Beginning in September
1993 BUSKI will exchange views annually with the Bank on the
progress made toward its implementation and on its proposed update
of the action plan. If any of theses revLews shows an
unsatisfactory performance, BUSKI will, by the end of November of
each year, starting in 1994, provide to the Bank a satisfactory
alternative.
(v)   The BMN will carry out an action plan, with timetable, coverLng the
1993-2000 period, for a major restructuring of the organizational
arrangements for solid waste management (para. 5.30). Beginning in
September 1993, the BMM will annually exchange views with the Bank
on progress made toward its implementation (para. 5.31).
(vi)   BUSKI will produce starting in 1993 funds internally generated for
investment during the current year, the previous year and the
following year equivalent to no less than 502 of the entity's
capital expenditures incurred during the current and the previous
year and the capital expenditures expected to be incurred during
the following year (para. 6.14); and,
(vii) BUSKI and the BMM will take the necessary measures to mitigate the
project environmental impacts (para. 7.16).



51
8.02       In addition, agreements on the following standbrd requlr.muts
were obtained from BUSKI and the BMM:
(i)    the use of the World Bank's Guidelines on procuremant (pares. 4.22,
and 4 25);
(ii)   periodical reporting on the progreas of the Project  plemencation
and preparation of a Project Compltion Report (para. 4.31); and,
(iII) annual audits of financial accounts and Special Accounts, and
financial reporting to the Bank (par"s. 5.19 and 5.32).
Condition for Xffectivenesa of the Loans
8.03       As a condition of effectiveness, the consultants for provision
of technical assistance regarding institutional development would buav to be
selected by BUSKI and the Municipality (pares. 4.17, 4.24 and 5.22). This
is progressing well and is presently estimated to be achleved by the end of
MNy 1993.
8.04       With the above agreements and conditions, the proposed project
would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$117.0 million equivalent to the
Bursa Water Supply and Sewerage Authority and a Bank loan of US$12.5 millIon
equivalent to the Bursa Metropolitan Municipallty. Both loans vould be for
a period of 17 years, including five years grace period, at the standard
variable interest rate.

The project also includes the 2nd phase of construction of the works in
the Eastern and Western Plants. The 2nd phase works would make use of
the pre-treatment facilities constructed in the 1st phase and add
activated sludge treatment and sludge treatment facilities. This would
result in an effluent standard of 20 mg/l BOD and 30 mg/l suspended
solids. Provision would be made to add units to achieve a higher
standard up to full nitrification, if necessary. The detailed design of
the activated sludge treatment facilities wlll be finalized only after
commissioning of the anaerobic ponds and review of the precise
characteristics of the wastewater collected form the newly connected
residential, commercial and industrial areas. The capacity of the 2nd
phase works would be as follows:

3.    Sludge sRougsal
Several methods of sludge disposal have been considered. The
incineration and the conversion (production of marketable end products)
methods which involve relatively high level of technology are not viable
options for a city like Bursa which is surrounded by large areas of
agricultural land. The methods of land application (in either liquid or
semi-dried form), land dumping, and composting have been compared. In
the case of Bursa, the most suitable method is land application whereby
the sludge is conveyed by tanker to agricultural land where it can be
spread on the surface or injected into the soil depending on the nature
of the soil available at the time.
During the first phase of the development, when anaerobic ponds are
used, the rate of sludge production will be greatly reduced since the
sludge accumulates in the ponds and reduces in bulk due to the anaerobic
digestion. Sludge removed once a year will be suitable for direct land
application without further treatment.
During the 2nd phase, the activated sludge process will produce large
quantities of surplus sludge. During the first year of production,
heated digestors would not be needed since the sludge can be stored in
the ponds originally used as anaerobic ponds to permit some
stabilization to take place. Later, once construction of the digestors
is completed, the sludge can be stabilized in the heated digestors and
applied to land with only minor crop restrictions. The detailed design
of the sludge treatment facilities will be finalized only after review
of the characteristics of the sludge collected from the activated sludge
facilities. Since the demand for sludge for agriculture purposes tends
to be seasonal, sludge will be temporarily stored in lagoons near the
land disposal areas.

Solid Waste Part
DoesrWiton
A.    Rehabilitatiop of Existinag Dum Slte
1.    Fire Control Works.  The waste on fire will be dug out by a long-
armed excavator and/or bull-dozed from the top onto the adjoining
land where it can be smothered by running a tracked vehicle over
it and drenching it with water.
2.    Stream Diversion.  The stream existing in the south-west of the
site will be diverted in order to prevent surface waters from
coming into contact with waste.
3.   Bund.  A low permeability bund (one meter high, volume 875 m3)
will be constructed over 350 meters to reinforce the stream
diversion, protect against flood conditions and prevent leachate
from entering the stream.
4.   Leachate Control.  A collection drain (1030 m long) will connect
to a leachate collection lagoon (5000 m3 capacity). The lagoon
vill be equipped with a conventional pump and transmission
pipework for disposal of effluent which may be used for
Irrigation.
'.   Regrading, capping, soil placement and planting to achieve a
"dome* shape to the final landfill and establish a vegetative mass
capable of sustained evapo-transpiration of the leachate volume.
6.    Surface Water Collection Ditch.  A 1280 m long ditch around a
significant percentage of the perimeter of the site will collect
discharge run-off from the restored landfill and discharge it to a
surface water ditch.
7.   Landfill Gas Venting. A system of trenches, backfilled with
gravel will prevent die-back of vegetation on the restored
landfill urface.

B.    Dev8lopment of New Site (Sub-valley X) at Hmnitle  Valley
1.   Access Road From Public Highway to Site Entrance.  The road will
be 2.5 km long. It would be 8 m wide, with 20 cm of concrete and 7
cm of cover with bitumen-asphalt.
2.   Access Road from Site Entrance to Landfill Area.  It would be 0.4
km long and cover a surface of 8,600 m2.
3.    Site Excavation and Land Clearing.  This would involve 40,000 m3
of excavation.
4.   Construction of a main bund and ramp with a total volume of
175,000 m3.
5.   Construction of a small building for office and messroom, and of a
maintenance area for vehicle and equipment.
6.   Installation of a weighbridge of 40 tonnes capacity.
7.   Other works including base preparation with clay and geomembrane
spreading, sub and surface drainage with construction of a ditch
2m deep over 2 km for control of surface water, fencing with a 2m
high fence over 2 km, separate areas for disposal of industrial
waste, leachate collection and pre-treatment in a lagoon before
disposal off-site.
8.   Supply of a mobile plant comprising compactor, tracked dozer,
excavator, dump truck and pumps.
C.   Waste Transfer Station
1.   The solid waste will be emptied from the local collection vehicles
into a reception pit from which the waste will be loaded by two
mobile grabs into 76 m3 open topped semi-trailers which will be
taken by road tractors to the waste disposal site. The 600 tonnes
per day station covering an area of 170m x 85m will have two
covered tipping balls, two weighbridges, an office of about 25 m2
and internal roadways of about 5,561 m2.
2.   Supply of one mobile grab and one loader.
3.   Supply of two slave tractors for haulage of semi-trailer at the
disposal site.
D.    Waste Collection
1.   For municiDal solid watte, the following equipment would be
needed:
A.   17 rear-end load vehicles of 14 mW unit capacity and one



67                            AnneZ 4.2
Page 3 of 4
vehicle of 10 m3 unit capacity;
b.   6 bulk haul semi-trailers 76 m3 unit capacity.
2.   For industrial waste, a separate collection service for industrial
waste management service needs to be established. The full extent
of the service and associated capital costs can only be determined
from the action plan when detailed statistics are available. As an
indication the following equipment would be needed:
a.   Two skip vehicles (2 axle);
b.   80 containers of 6 m3 unit capacity.
The hydrogeological investigations have shown that the
permeability specified for the landfill of hazardous waste can be
met for Hamilter. Landfill will be used as the short term disposal
option for hazardous industrial solids, sludges and small
quantities of liquids. These wastes will be jointly disposed with
domestic wastes in a separate area of the Hamilter landfill. This
area will be further divided to allow disposal of incompatible
waste. The present quantities of waste for which incineration is
the preferred option do not justify a dedicated hazardous waste
Incinerator in the short term. Following the collection of
accurate statistics, the long term disposal of waste not suitable
for recovery or reuse and to be incinerated will be assessed as
part of the action plan (Annex 5.4. Table 2.1).
S.    linical Wwate
1.   The new service will be implemented in phases with new collection
equipment being introduced as knowledge increases and service
expands. In phase 1 hospitals and clinics would be served. In
phase 2, service would be extended to selected doctors, dentists
and veterinary practices. In phase 3, service would be extended
to remaining health care service. The information on waste gained
in phase 1 and 2 would provide data for specification of an
incinerator (rotary kiln or static hearth design). The project
would provide the equipment for a 0.5 tonne per hour incineration
unit but the corresponding building will provide for future
installation of a second unit.
2.   Collection equipment would involve purchasing of two 20 m3
capacity box vans.
F.   Technical Assistance to the  un1icipalaity
Technical assistance and equipment for:
1.   detailed design and construction supervision of the above solid
waste management works;

Page 4 of 4
2.   detailed design for the next phase of development of the Hamilter
valley; end,
3.    technical assistance and equipment for institutional improvements
regarding:
a.    implementation of an action plan for waste collection and
transfer including a detailed study to optimize waste
collection schedules, a trial to evaluate front-end load
vehicles, a reorganization of the existing vehicle
workshops;
b.    implementation of an action plan for clinical waste
including introduction of regulations in Greater Bursa with
possible extension to the Province, development of a code of
practlce, and a detailed site selection study for the
incinerators;
C.    implementation of an action plan for industrial waste
including the development of a separate collection service,
the development of landfill disposal facilities at the new
landfill, and a detailed feasibility study to develop a
long-term strategy for Bursa.

O     designing and implementing a Recording Management
Information System, based on the attached terms of reference
and timetable (Attachment 5);
o     preparing a new tarlff schedule, based on a detalled
marginal cost pricing study and impleaenting the
recom_endations of the study (Attachment 6). The study will
include development of a strategy for charging for
lndustrial waste water and will recommend how existing
legislation will be applied in order to maximize revenue
Lncomea; and
O     carrying out feaslbility studies for contracting out with a
private firm the operatLon of water supply and sewerage

TwiMnLUgArrangmen
5.   BUSKI's management will implement tho Actlon Plan with the help of
consultants under the Bank-financed project. Also, taking into consideratlon
that the different elements (training, unaccounted-for water, asset and
capital investment management, recordlng management and information system,
%ie tariff study; and the feasLbility of contraeting out the provision of
services) of the Plan aro closely interrelated, BUSgI's management will
contract the consulting services for those elements with a highly developed
water company (L.e. a twinning agency) able and willing to transfer its
engineering, operational, and managerLal capabilities to BUSKI.  BUSXI will
select the twinnlng agency before loan effectiveness, and will hire it by June
1993.
EEaluating  grass in CoxULN.out Che AtLon 
6.    Progress toward implementing the Action Plan and achieving the targets
would be evaluated annually, with a view to update it taking into account the
lessons learned during its execution.

actions by BUSKI's Board and management, including:
increasing the number of connections;
raising the average water and sewerage tariff levels (including
special charges for the discharge of industrial effluent);
increasing the volume of water billed as a percentage of water
production, from 391 in 1992 to 511 in 2000; and
improving the bill collection performance.
5.    Personnel productivity should increase as a result of improved
managerial and administrative procedures, and of the training program.
6.    Figures are in current dollars, assuming the following rates of
international inflation: 1992: 2.81; 1993 and 1994: 3.91; 1995 and

lURa=WT  AND £RA3IATO  PROJECT
Water Supply and Sewerage
Traininug Program
Objer,tive
1.   The objective of the training program is to provide BUSKI staff with the
skills and knowledge required to enable the entity to improve its operational,
cnmmercial, and financial performance. The training program would emphasize
project related needs, but would also provide a continuing capability to
identify and meet staff development requirements in the future.
Scone of the Training Comnonent
2.    The training component would facilitate the training of approximately
60X of BUSKI staff over a five-year period. Achieving this goal would
necessitate strengthening BUSKI's training section. The training section
would receive the appropriate facilities, staff, and technical assistance to
plan, coordinate, monitor, and evaluate training activities. The tralning
section would work closely with the operating units and BUSKI's managers to
identify training needs, and to implement a training program based on these
perceived needs.
3.    The training program should reach the top management and the medium and
lower levels in the organization. Three type of training modes will be
utilized to the extent considered appropriate:g program: on-the-job training;
training by local institutions; and educational visits overseas to more
developed water and sanitation agencies.
Qn-the-Job Training
4.    Training needs at the operational and lower levels of BUSKI would be
addressed by on-the-job training. On-the-job training would be a formal
planned activity conducted at the worksite using job tasks as training for the
employees. To implement the on-the-job training, the training department
would first develop a training of trainers course which, over the four years
of the project, would train approximately ten selected BUSKI staff in training
techniques. The twinning agency will participate in providing the necessary
technical content to the training activities, and in assisting the trainers in
carrying out their tasks. During the project, approximately 500 staff would
be trained on the job, mainly in the operations and maintenance, and
commercial areas.



Annex 5.2
78                           Page 2 of 3
Local Inst:itutigo
5.    In areas such as information systems; including accounting, budgeting
and computers where identified training needs cannot be met by BUSKI staff and
the expertise exists in Turkey, WSKI staff at all levels will attend selected
courses provided by specialized institutions.
Visits Overswea
6.   Introducing new managerial and operational approaches will require that
BUSKI staff visit water supply agencies more developed than BUSKI. Selected
BUSKI staff, predominately managers and tecbnicians, will study at the
twinning agency, following detailed terms of reference. This twinning
activity would be critlcal to project success because the staff upon their
return would be responsLble for working by themselves and with consultants to
initiate and implement up-to-date managerial and operational practices.
Annual Programs
7.    The trainlng program would be developed on a rolling basis each year and
will be perceived as an essential element of BUSKI's Action Plan (Plan) for
improved operational, commercial, and financial performance. A central
training committee composed of mid- and top-level managers would be formed to
first develop a training policy, and program, and then guide and monitor the
progress of the program. At the operational level, groups would be formed to
identify training needs and monitor all training activities conducted in the
unit, especially on-the-job training activities. After initial project start-
up, these groups would work together to annually develop a training program
based on an institution-wide training needs analysis coordinated by the
training department. The annual programs should cover all areas of BUSKI's
activities with emphasis on those being improved under the World Bank-financed
project, and under the Plan.
Technical Assistance
8.   Two areas of tcchnical assistance would be required to implement the
training component. First, the twinning agency will assist BUSKI in: (1)
establishing the training unit and the necessary codmittees within BUSKI; (2)
identifying training needs; (3) developing a training program; and (4)
initiating an ongoing monLtoring system. Second, conducting a four-year
evaluation during the final semester of the project.
Evaluation
9.   The results of the tralinng program should be evaluated every year, and
the lessons learned during the evaluation should be incorporated in the
formulation of the subsequent annual training program. A final four-year
evaluation would be conducted to assess the overall effects of the training
component of the project and to draw lessons for further development of
BUSKI's training activities. Particular attention should be placed to the
full integration of the tralaing program with the other elements of the Plan.

BUR"A WATER AND SaUITnRION PROJECT
Water Supply and Sewerage
Reducing UnaCcWunted-for Water Program
Obiective
1.   The objective of the Reducing Unaccounted-for Water (UFW) project
component is to reduce the economic losses to Bursa's population resulting
from the water losses in the system (physical losses), as well as to reduce
the financial losses to BUSKI resulting from the physical losses and from the
water being consumed but not paid for (commercial losses).
Scone of the UFW Component
2.    The starting point for the design of the UFW project component is the
recognition that BUSKI's high levels of 'unaccounted-for water", and of other
'non-revenue earning water", are the result of many operational and policy-
related factors. These factors include inadequate construction standards and
specifications; insufficient allocation of resources for system's operation
and maintenance; inadequate cost recovery policies; and inadequately trained
personnel. Thus, the UFN project component comprises four major areas:
construction standards and specifications; system's operations and
maintenance; system's rehabilitation and upgrading; commercialization policies
and practices. Personnel training will be carried out under the training
program. Progress in all areas is essential for the success and
sustainability of the project.
3.    The details of the items to be addressed under each one of the five
areas of the project component, and the timetable for their implementation are
outlined below:
A.   Construction Standards and Specifications
*     implementing updated standards and specifications for
installations and equipment, for both major and minor works
such as secondary distribution networks;
*     improving the supervision of construction work, and of
equipment installation and repair;
B.    System's Operation and Maintenance
*     setting-up a mapping system for the water supply and
sewerage systems;



AnexS 5.2
Atta    n31

*    purchasing and installing meters in water sources, water
storage tanks, and water mains, and establishing 20 pilot
district meter areas a year between 1994 and 1997.
*     controlling and, when appropriate, reducing pressures in the
system;
*    putting in place a systematic leak detection and repair
program;
*     implementing preventive maintenance programs for large and
small meters;
C.    System's Rehabilitatign and Uggrading
*    replacing, rehabilitating and upgrading at least 50 km. of
deteriorated pipe and multiple supply lines a year between
1994 and 1997. The program will need to take account of the
requirements of the asset management plan.
D.    Conmercializatin
-    metering public fountains and park consumption, and charging
the municipality for water consumption;
*    verifying the accuracy of the customer records and updating
them as necessary;
implementing updated standards and specifications for new
meters;
*    replacing under-registering consumption meters at a rate of
10,000 meters a year between 1994 and 1997;
*    reviewing and revising, as necessary, the meter reading
system (including the control of meter readers), and the
billing and collection systems; and
*     strengthening the programs for checking for illegal
connections.
Ignlementina the UNFW Component
4.    Implementing the UFW project component would require a strong
institutional commitment, including the sufficient allocation of human and
financial resources. A first step would be the creation of a unit
(Operational Control Unit) with the basic responsibility of steering and
coordinating the execution of this project component. BUSKI's operating
departments will carry out the day-to-day activities under the project
component, and to this effect they will appoint staff with the basic
responsibility of coordinating with the Operational Control Unit, and of
steering the execution of the project related task within their respective
units.

Technical Assistance
5.   Specialists with expertise in highly developed water supplies would be
required to assist BUSKI in carrying out the above tasks. The expertise
required include commercialization of metered water and sewerage services, and
system's operations and maintenance. About 30 man-months of technical
assistance are envisaged.
TrainLng
6.    The twimning agency should make every effort to transfer its   skills to
BUSKI's staff. Most of this transfer would take place through on-the-job
training during the process of carrying out the different tasks under the
project. In addition, the twinning agency will assist BUSKI's training unit
in preparing and executing a plan of seminars addressed to BUSKI's staff to
provide information on:
O     the objectives and scope of the technical assistance work;
progress made; and updated work plans until full achievement of
the objectives; and
o     the operation, maintenance, development, and use of the systems
and methods being implemented.
7.   The twinning agency should also assist BUSKI in the formulation and
implementation of the training activities required to support the UNW program.
Evaluation
8.   The results of the UFW project component should be evaluated every year,
and the lessons learned during the evaluation should be incorporated in the
formulation of the subsequent annual program of activities. A final five-year
evaluation would be conducted to assess the overall effects of the UFW
component of the project and to draw lessons for further BUSKT's development.

customers demands (for example: percentage of population to be
served; water pressure shall be maintained at no less than In'
meters head for all customers); and the acceptable degree of
compliance with the coverage and standards (for example: the dates
by which the standards will be fully met);
O     the investments required to meet the standards, and the main
objective of each investment. The main objectives foreseen are:
*     preserving assets to ensure that their residual lfie is
achieved, and that their performance is adequate to met the
established standards;
*     enhancing, improving or expanding assets to meet the
standards;

Objective
1.    The objective of the tariff study is to design a tariff system for BUSKI
which meets the following criteria: (i) allows the entity to generate
sufficient income for meeting its financial requirements; (ii) provides
incentives for conserving water and for undertaking pollution control and
abatement activities; (iii) reflects as closely as possible the costs to the
economy of meeting increasing demands for water and sewerage services; and
(iv) ensures that services will be affordable to the whole population.
622RG
2.    The scope of the tariff study will include:
(a)   estimating the incremental costs for the water supply system,
resulting from building new capacity, rehabilitating and updating
infrastructure, reducing unaccounted-for water, and operating and
maintaining the infrastructure;
(b)   estimating the incremental costs for the sewerage system,
resulting from building new capacity and operating and maintaining
the infrastructure. The capacity cost includes investments for
sewerage connections, collectors and pumping stations,
interceptors, and final disposition and treatment;
(c) estimating the incremental cost of servicing different types of
customers with water supply;
(d)   estimating the incremental cost of servicing different types of
customers with sewerage services, taking into account both the
quantity and quality of the effluent, so that the costs of the
sewage system and treatment can be equitably and efficiently
distributed between domestic and industrial dischargers and
between the various industrial firms;
(e)   estimating the financial requirements for BUSKI meeting pre-
established targets such as a viable cash position, contribution
to investments from internal generation of funds, and debt
service; and
(f)   estimating the customer's ability to pay for the services.
3.   The study, based on the estimates enumerated in para. 2 should
recomend:



Annex 5.2
90                          ttachment 6
Page 2 of 2
(a) alternative tarlff policies which meet the requirements outlined
in para. 1;
(b) a plan of action and strategy to implemut the recommendd tariff
policies, to the extent that Bursa and BUSKI's authorities have
the legal capability to do it;
(c) organizational arrange_.nts required in BUSKI to ensure the
continued implementation of the tariff policies;
(d)   changes in the legal framework within which BUSKI operetes, whieh
will enable the entity to fully meet the objectives set out for
the tariff policy; and
(e) ways in which the authorities and the public can be made more
aware of the need of implementing the proposed tariff policy.
Technical Assistance
4.   Consultants with expertise in tariff settlng within a developed water
undertaking will be required. Experience of operating within a regulatory
framework and of pollcing a charging policy, both domestic and industrial,
will be necessary. The technical assistance should be available to monitor
and evaluate progress on implementation.
TZxDinna
5.    In view of the political impact of tariffs it is important that
awareness training takes place early in the project to ensure that the
implications of the project and the importance of cbarging systems are
understood at the highest levels within BUSKI
6.    Training in the development and use of cost models will be needed and
this will be provided by the consultants.
7.   Progress on Implementing the recommended tariff policies should be
monitored annually (for two consecutive years) by the consultant. This will
be particularly important in the area of industrial waste charging.

1.   The objective of the study is to analyze the ecoomic, legal and
financial feasibility of contracting out with a private firm the provision of
water and sewerage services in lurea.
2.   The study will look at practices of contractlg out the provision of
services with the private sector both within Turkey as well as
Internationally. It will review exlsting legislation and clearly define
action plans and timetables should chane be recomnded. Political
constraints should be identified at both local'and national level. In
particular the study will cover at lesst the followng :
the extent to which regulation and provision of services could or
should be separated;
review of existing initiatives in Turkey, such as the Kmer
Scheme;
the scope and opportunities for private sector involvement,
including:
scope of the services;
assessment of the financial risks acceptable by the private
firm; and
assessment of capital requiremts for the private firm;
contracting methods and remuneration to the private flrm;
methods for monitoring the private firzm performance, and for
enforcing compliance with its contractual obligations;
procedures for selecting a private firm;
preliminary identification of private firms able to contract the
provision of services; and
the potential savings and service Iprovements that could accrue
from recommended courses of action.
3.   The review will state the key featurs of all arrngemnts investigated
and compare the advantages of each. Uhero a particular arr agmt is
advocated an outline specification will be provided togther with suggested

monitoring and evaluation procedures. This could be in the form of a skeleton
or specimen contract.
4.    A second stage of the technical assistance could be required if the
authorities decide to implement the recommendations of the study. The second
stage of the technical assistance would include:
preparing the Invitation to prequalify firms;
preparing the bidding documents;
drafting the required legal documents; and
assisting in the selection of the private firm and in the
negotiation of the final contract.
Technical Assistance
5.    A broad view is required and advice will be needed from a range of
experts experienced in the formulation and administration of the various
possible contracting arrangements. Experience in the application of Turkish
law in this context will also be necessary.
TraLutng
6.   Whilst no training can be undertaken until the outcome of the study is
known, the consultant should hold seminars for senior msanagers and politicians
to explain the options fully and indicate the benefits of any recommended
change. This will apply both to the competition issue and the business
practice element.

In their endeavour. to Improve the sltuntion with regard to solid waste
management in Bursa, the Metropolitan Municipallty together with the Dlstrict
Munictpalities of YildirLa, Niluter and Osmangazi have agreed to undertake a major
restructuring of their organizational arrangements for the managemet of solid
waste. The main aims of the restructuring are:
*     to Increase the transparency of the mmnicipal solid waste service In
terms of financing sources and costs;
*     to expose the service to open competition; and
e     to make it more accountable and responsive to the citizen needs.
In order to achieve these aims, the restructuring will include the following:
*     the creation of a regulatory body within the Metropolitan Municipality
to oversee and enforce environmental laws and regulations relating to
air, land and water pollution, the safe and proper disposal of solid and
liquid wastes, and other environmental matters, within the boundaries of
the Metropolitan Municipality.
the creation of an operational corporation responsible for providing
services for the management of the following:
*     household waste collections;
*     clinical waste collections;
*     industrial waste collections;
*     landfill site operations.
*     the contracting out of at least part of the collection service.
ag= tgSvce
It is the municipalities' intention that they will support the new corporation
for a two year period financially and that it will undertake the whole of the
collection and disposal service, apart from small trial collection contracts wthich
will be let individually by the municipalities. After two years. it is the
intention that the service be exposed to competitive tendering, presuming that at
this stage sufficiently experienced and capable competitors have evolved.
