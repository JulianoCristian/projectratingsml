development impacts were achieved. Among the\n            lessons learned, it is specifically addressed that special\n            attention should have been given during project preparation,\n            to the design, and implementation of technical assistance in\n            strengthening institutional capacity, by establishing the\n            Borrower's commitment, and anticipating potential\n            disruptive factors, such as the lack of appropriate\n            counterpart staff. This requires that the Bank stay focused\n            on institutional development objectives, to avoid\n            unsuccessful arrangements - as in the case of the twinning\n            contract - where alternative options, such as the engagement\n            of a private operator, should have been pursued. In\n            addition, the Bank also needs to take into account the\n            broader objectives, and impacts of the project in the\n            setting of a monitoring and evaluation system, for while\n            physical, and institutional progress indicators were\n            developed, the system did not provide for evaluating\n            progress in achieving the larger objectives. Special\n            attention is also necessary in defining action programs with\n            committed support, e.g., on the reduction in non-revenue and\n            unaccounted for water, and, in establishing technical, and\n            financial viability of local contractors, to avoid delays,\n            e.g., the sewage treatment plants."}, "docdt": "2001-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
