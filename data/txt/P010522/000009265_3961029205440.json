The project will support:\n            1) the Department of Agriculture's work program,\n            including the extension services for horticulture,\n            fisheries, and livestock to poor rural communities aimed at\n            increasing their production; 2) institutional development\n            (technology generation and extension, seed multiplication\n            and land administration, and planning and coordination); and\n            3) rural infrastructure (small scale irrigation and rural\n            roads). The project will also include a number of studies\n            considered necessary for improving the use of natural\n            resources and the marketing of highly perishable\n            horticultural products."}, "docdt": "1995-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
