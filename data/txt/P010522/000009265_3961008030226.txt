MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON THE PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA
FOR ASSAM RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on the proposed
Development Credit of SDR 81.0 million (US$ 126.0 million equivalent) to India
is submitted for approval. The IDA credit would be on standard terms, with 35
years maturity, to help finance the Assam Rural Infrastructure and
Agricultural Services Project.
2.        Background.  India is the world's second most populous country with
a population exceeding 880 million, and growing at an average rate of 2.0% per
year. In 1991 the Government of India (GOI) started to liberalize the
country's economy with a reform program focused on the investment regime,
trade policies, financial sector, public enterprises, and taxation. The
economy has responded positively to the stabilization and reform measures
implemented, but macroeconomic stress brought about by the reform program
poses new challenges for policy. Growth recovered from 2% per year, in
1991/92 to around 4% per year in 1993/94. Details of the macroeconomic
performance are described in the Bank Report "Recent Economic Developments and
Prospects for India (Report No. 12940-IN)" of May 27, 1994.
3.        Agricultural growth has averaged 2.6% per annum over the last two
decades, slightly above the population growth rate of 2.1%. Despite
comparatively modest growth, agriculture remains important to the Indian
economy. Though agriculture's share of GDP is only about 35%, a large
percentage of India's population is dependent on the sector. About 75% of
India's people live in rural areas, and about 64% are directly employed in
agriculture.
4.        Though the performance of the agricultural sector has improved over
the same period of the reform program (for example, through increased
exports), there remain long-standing issues facing the development of
agriculture in India. Without broad-ranging reforms, the prospects for
accelerated, sustainable, and equitable growth are not encouraging. Some
contributing factors for the inadequate performance of the agricultural
sector, some of which were brought out in the Bank's recent public expenditure
review, include excessive expenditures for subsidies on inputs and outputs,
low levels of cost recovery for services provided by government, restrictions
on both domestic and external trade, and the weak structure of the rural
credit system.
5.        Public expenditures on agriculture have been increasing at about 5%
per year in real terms, with the recurrent component increasing at about 8%
and the capital formation component declining by about 2%. These trends,
evident at both the central and the state level, are unsustainable and have
become worse over the past five years. The challenge for the future is to
accelerate growth by improving the technical, financial, and economic
efficiencies in the sector while paying greater attention to the equity
aspects of development, the sustainability of the production base, and the
preservation of the environment.
6.        Although public expenditures have been instrumental in facilitating
agricultural growth, Indian agriculture is at a critical stage. Gains in the
agricultural sector have not been sufficiently large to alleviate poverty
among the growing population. The challenge is to increase the growth rate of



-2-
production to support population growth and raise living standards. This
requires a critical reevaluation of the composition of public expenditure and
the efficiency of allocation.
7.        The incomplete liberalization of the trade regime, in particular
for consumer goods, continues to discriminate against agriculture by
depressing farmers' incentives to invest and produce. Within agriculture,
government price controls, market interventions, and trade regulations
restrict growth opportunities.
8.        Although the broad economic environment is under the control of the
central government, the constitution assigns responsibility for agriculture to
the states. The central government finances about 40% of agricultural
expenditure at the state level but does not influence the composition of the
states' public expenditures. As a result of this shared responsibility, any
reform process becomes difficult to implement.
9.        Distortions in the incentive structure and management weakness not
only reduce growth but also threaten its long-term sustainability. The two
main issues are (a) over-exploitation and inefficient use of the natural
resource base induced by pricing distortions, such as underpricing of water
and power, and (b) poor operation and maintenance of irrigation and other
infrastructure. Major land and water resources in India have been developed
and utilized. Future growth must depend largely on intensified production (on
both irrigated and rainfed land), crop diversification and increased
efficiency.
10.       The GOI's Agricultural Strateqy.  The GOI's long-term strategy is
to stimulate agricultural growth and promote rural development through
improved water and land management, enhanced efficiency of irrigation and
drainage networks, strengthened research services, increased attention to
environmental protection, and improved rural infrastructure. Investment
programs to address these elements and to reestablish growth are assigned a
high priority in the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1992/97) of the GOI and state
governments. The Plan also emphasizes equitable distribution of the benefits
of growth and sustainability of the resource base.
11.       According to the Plan, increasing public support for agriculture
would focus on horticulture, livestock, fisheries, and sericulture. The plan
aims at infusing new dynamism through redirecting public investments in
infrastructural development and promoting private investment in the
agricultural sector. The Plan gives priority to improving rainfed agriculture
through diversification, creating incentives for exports, increasing the role
of the private sector, enhancing the effectiveness of the safety net programs,
and using natural resources in a sustainable manner.
12.       The State of Assam.  Assam, the largest of seven northeastern
states, is among the poorest in the country. About 60% of the rural
population have incomes below the official poverty line of Rs 7,800 (US$240)
per household per year. The State covers an area of 78,000 sq km, of which
34,000 sq km (44%) are cultivable; the remainder is under forest or
uncultivable. The State mainly comprises the valley of the Brahmaputra River,
stretching from the Himalayan foothills in the northeast to its entry into
Bangladesh in the southwest. There are three main regions: the flat,
rice-dominated valley bottom; the foothill areas, which to the north and east
are largely under tea cultivation; and the less prosperous, hilly tracts to
the south bordering the states of Meghalaya and Nagaland.



-3-
13.       The population of Assam is estimated at 22.3 million, with a growth
rate of 3.6% per year, compared to 2.7% for all India. The most striking
feature is the growing unemployment among educated youths, estimated at almost
60%. Even for those with steady incomes from employment, wages have been
declining in real terms over the last 20 years. Minimum wages in Assam
average Rs 15 per day compared with Rs 23 to 25 per day in other states such
as Haryana, Punjab, and Manipur.
14.       Agriculture in Assam: Constraints and Potential.  Rainfall in Assam
averages over 2,000 mm per year, permitting double-cropping in many areas.
The state suffers from frequent floods, soil erosion, and low cropping
intensity. Surface and groundwater resources are abundant but have not been
exploited fully. Despite good water resources, the average yield of rice, the
dominant crop, is only 1,150 kg per hectare, well below the national average
of 1,500 kg per ha. Where irrigation facilities exist, higher yields can and
are being obtained from the dry season rice crop. There is considerable
potential for agricultural growth by increasing cropping intensity, raising
rice yields, and diversifying into higher-value activities such as
horticulture, fisheries, and dairy production.
15.       Issues affecting agricultural growth in the state include:
(a) poorly developed input supply services;
(b) inadequacy of groundwater development;
(c) poorly developed rural infrastructure (e.g., rural roads,
marketing, electrification, and communications);
(d) problems of flood management and drainage in flood-prone areas; and
(e) failure to tailor agricultural research and technology transfer to
local conditions.
16.       The poor performance of the agricultural sector in the State is
partly caused by a low level of fertilizer use, poor quality seed, inadequate
use of conjunctive irrigation with high rainfall, small and fragmented land
holdings, absence of rural credit, and deficiencies in research and extension
services. Government policies have traditionally promoted public sector
control of input distribution, reduce direct public expenditure for capital
formation in the agricultural sector, restrict private sector involvement in
the provision of essential goods and services, subsidize inefficient public
corporations, and distort competition. Resources for operation and
maintenance of public infrastructure, including irrigation and drainage, rural
roads, and power generating units, have been routinely inadequate.
17.       Intensification and diversification of agriculture are essential
for accelerating growth in Assam. This shift requires a strategic approach to
increase productivity and minimize crop losses that distributes risk and
encourages small farmers to respond to changes in market and production
technology. The average farm size of 1.3 hectares is the smallest in the
country and declining. These small land holdings are fragmented further into
3 to 4 parcels, making them uneconomic units to support the average family of
five. Land consolidation should encourage intensification of agriculture in



-4-
the large flood-free areas, on the recharged aquifers, in perennial streams
and rivulets, and in the vast low-lying areas with adequate
residual moisture to raise early-maturing second crops. Successful
intensification would require revamped agricultural research and extension
services, staff training, infrastructure development, and a supportive policy
environment.
18.       The GOA recently formulated an agricultural strategy to foster
growth and development. The strategy includes policy adjustment and targets
small and poor farming communities to (a) develop area-specific assets and
infrastructure required to support productive and sustainable farming systems;
(b) plan and execute relevant research, extension, and training programs for
accelerated agricultural growth, and (c) create a favorable policy and
investment framework and an enabling environment for active private sector
participation.
19.       The GOA has succeeded in enlisting the support of the World Food
Program, local and national NGOs, and other bilateral agencies to implement
this strategy. This collaboration has already resulted in several small-scale
projects for fish production, livestock improvement, groundwater development,
and road construction in rural India. Further resources will be needed to
expand these development activities.
20.       World Bank Support.  The Bank has supported agriculture and rural
development in India since the early 1950s. One hundred thirty-three projects
have received IBRD or IDA financing totaling US$10.6 billion equivalent (81%
IDA and 19% IBRD). Of these projects, 53 were for irrigation and command area
development (US$5.2 billion equivalent, or 50t of total agricultural lending).
The remaining 80 projects can be subdivided as follows: (a) 34 for
agricultural support services (credit, research, and extension), at US$2.3
billion equivalent; (b) 24 for commercial agriculture development (fisheries,
livestock, tree crops, and agro-industry), at US$1.6 billion equivalent; (c)
12 for forestry, at US$500 million equivalent; and (d) 10 other projects
including area development, drought assistance, and cyclone emergency
projects, at US$950 million equivalent.
21.       In policy reform and lending for agriculture, the Bank has
supported two agricultural development projects (ADPs) in Tamil Nadu and
Rajasthan whose implementation has been satisfactory. The Government of Tamil
Nadu (GOTN) has eliminated subsidies for agricultural inputs including seeds,
fertilizers, and pesticides. The Government of Rajasthan has increased
expenditure for long-term investment in agriculture by 20% and streamlined its
recurrent expenditure, and removed several distortions in its current
agricultural policies.
22.       The Bank Group has also supported an ADP (Cr.728-IN) with an amount
of US$8.0 million for Assam alone as well as 12 other projects in which Assam
participated along with other states, for a total credit and loan amount
equivalent to US$2.2 billion. Although the proposed project is similar to the
earlier ADP, the earlier ADP lacked policy reforms. The other projects
include four Agricultural Refinance and Development Corporation Credit
Projects (Cr. 540-IN, 715-IN, 947-IN, and 1209-IN and Ln. 2095-IN), two
National Dairy Projects (Cr. 824-IN and 859-IN and Ln. 2893-IN), two National
Agricultural Research Projects (Cr. 855-IN and 1631-IN), the National
Agricultural Extension Project (Cr. 1754-IN), the National Bank for
Agricultural and Rural Development Project (Ln. 2653), the National Seeds
Project (Cr. 1952-IN), and the Food Grain Storage Project (Cr. 747-IN).



-.5-
23.       Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement.  Many agricultural projects
that the Bank has supported have experienced implementation problems causing
delays in disbursement and completion, although there has recently been
improvement in disbursements. Problems include delays in project mobilization
and procurement; poor quality construction and maintenance of infrastructure
(e.g., irrigation, rural roads); institutional weaknesses; inadequate
financial support by the state governments; inadequate preparation and
implementation of resettlement and rehabilitation programs for affected
families; and poor maintenance of assets created by projects. Some projects
have faced staff constraints as well. Others have provided for only limited
participation of beneficiaries, including NGOs and women, in project planning
and implementation.
24.       Because the proposed project includes large investments in rural
roads and irrigation, lessons from the Bihar Rural Roads Project (Cr. 1072-IN)
and the Tube Wells Project in Bihar and West Bengal are relevant. Although
the Bihar Rural Roads Project achieved impressive physical targets of road
construction within the project period, the design, quality of construction,
and road maintenance were poor. As a result, the life of these roads was much
shorter than expected. Also, public tube wells in Bihar failed to irrigate
the intended cropped area because of weak beneficiary participation, resulting
in poor cost recovery for repair and maintenance. By contrast those in West
Bengal succeeded after they were handed over to farmer groups.
25.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project is consistent
with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for India presented to the
Executive Directors on May 12, 1994. Among other aspects, the CAS emphasizes
providing direct support for specific reforms through policy-based investment
operations at the sectoral, state, and economy-wide levels. As demonstrated
during the last two years, the Bank is uniquely placed to carry out a dialogue
on policy reform with the GOI and state governments and support implementation
of a reform program.
26.       The strategy places increased importance on private sector
initiative and responsibility. It involves:
(a) encouraging the private sector to supply goods and services that
now are provided exclusively by the public sector;
(b) introducing beneficiary participation in the design, operation and
maintenance, and financing and ownership of the assets created by
the investment; and
(c) effecting cost recovery for publicly supplied goods and services to
ensure accountability and sustained maintenance of assets.
27.       Given the hiQh incidence of poverty in the eastern states of India,
including Assam, there is need to redirect Bank assistance to these areas
where the marginal productivity of investment is high in order to create
regional balance and assist in the alleviation of poverty. The emphasis is on
balancing appropriate targeting and delivery of production support services to
increase the agricultural production of the poor on the one hand and efficient
resource allocation and a reduced role for the public sector on the other.
The GOA and the World Food Programme, participating NGOs, and other local



-6-
institutions have successfully implemented small-scale development activities
in food production and rural infrastructure in selected poor communities. The
Bank can play a unique role in assisting the GOA to expand these successful
pilot projects.
28.       Project Objectives.  The primary objectives of the project are to
(a) improve equity and alleviate poverty by offering employment opportunities
for poorer farmers and women to contribute to agricultural growth and income
generation; (b) improve the nutrition of the rural poor; (c) accelerate
agricultural growth through improved use of resources, relieving
infrastructural and technical constraints, and providing an enabling
environment to facilitate the growth of private sector investments; (d)
encourage sustainability of resource use and quality of the environment; and
(e) strengthen the agricultural policy framework and improve the GOA's
long-term capacity for strategic agricultural planning.
29.       Proiect Description.  The project is intended to benefit the
poorest segments of the rural population. To achieve this objective, the
project would support: (a) the Department of Agriculture's work program,
including the extension services for horticulture, fisheries, and livestock to
poor rural communities aimed at increasing their production; (b) institutional
development (technology generation and extension, seed multiplication and land
administration, and planning and coordination); and (c) rural infrastructure
(small scale irrigation and rural roads). Project components also include a
number of studies considered necessary for improving the use of natural
resources (soil and water management) and the marketing of highly perishable
horticultural products. The proposed project would be implemented in eight
years starting in 1995/96 and includes a package of state-specific policy
reforms agreed to by the Bank and formally approved by the GOA.
30.       Targeting of Low-Income Beneficiaries.  Project activities would be
targeted to selected farming communities according to agreed criteria
including accessibility of markets, availability of rural roads, and delivery
of inputs supplies. Within these communities, the project would target about
300,000 rural households cultivating about 49,000 hectares. Preference would
be given to households limited resources, including small land holdings, low
incomes (below the poverty line), and poor access to clean water. The project
would assist poor households, especially women cultivators and heads of
households, in acquiring access to water, employment, and improved nutrition
within their communities. The GOA through the baseline surveys would identify
the target group of the poorest in the rural area for project activities.
Other rural households and communities would benefit from the improvement and
rehabilitation of rural roads and agricultural services.
31.       Indigenous People.  Indigenous people (scheduled tribes and
scheduled castes) form about 18% of the plains population (in 21 of 23
districts) and are scattered over the entire state. The tribal population in
rural areas, which is engaged in agriculture and practices farming systems
similar to those of its neighbors, is among the beneficiaries of the project.
Two hill districts are predominantly tribal areas with a separate
administrative arrangement supported by the central government. Because of
the special nature of the hill districts in the state, the project would limit
its coverage to activities of highest potential, such as fruit production.
Under these circumstances, the project does not need a separate development
plan for the tribals.



-7-
32.       Proposed Reform Proqram.  During project preparation, a review of
the state budget revealed that recurrent expenditure in agriculture is
displacing investment and thereby adversely affecting agricultural growth.
The GOA in preparing its agricultural development strategy analyzed these
issues. The strategy includes (a) reduction of public sector delivery of
production inputs and services, (b) introduction of cost recovery where
possible and reduction of subsidies, (c) diversification of farming toward
products in which the state has comparative advantage, (d) liberalization of
state trade policy, (e) preparation and implementation of demand-driven
agricultural research programs, and (f) introduction of policy incentives to
promote private sector involvement in agriculture.
33.       To implement the above strategy, GOA has formulated a policy reform
action plan. During negotiations, GOA confirmed its commitment to implement
the policy reform action plan. Under the plan, GOA would:
(a) encourage private and cooperative sector investment in fisheries
development by extending lease periods for water bodies from three
to 7 years by issuing related government orders during 1996;
(b) issue government orders by the end of 1996 to invite private sector
companies and individuals to operate and manage foundation and
certified seed multiplication farms and horticultural nurseries
currently run by the Agriculture Department and public agencies;
(c) prepare a five-year plan by the end of 1996 to phase out GOA
subsidies on agricultural inputs, except those for tribals and
scheduled castes covered by special programs;
(d) phase out subsidies for farm machinery hire service offered by the
Engineering Wing of the Department of Agriculture to encourage
private sector involvement by the end of 1996;
(e) initiate implementation of the Irrigation Act of 1992 in 1996,
according to an agreed plan that would allow full cost recovery of
water from beneficiaries, including the cost of electricity for
public deep tube wells and lift irrigation schemes;
(f) during 1996, issue a government order to facilitate transfer of new
and rehabilitated irrigation schemes under the project to
beneficiaries;
(g) prepare during 1996 a schedule for phasing out non-viable public
sector enterprises in agriculture; and
(h) during 1996, assign responsibility for fisheries policy development
to the Department of Fisheries to include all public water bodies.
34.       Project Costs and FinancinQ.  Total project costs including
physical and price contingencies are estimated at Rs 5,677.5 million (US$146.6
million), of which US$10.1 million, or 6.0% of base costs, would be in foreign
exchange. Investment costs and recurrent costs amount to 77% and 23% of base
costs, respectively. An IDA Credit of SDR 81.0 million (US$126.0 million)
would finance 90t of project costs, excluding taxes and duties. The breakdown
of costs and financing is shown in Schedule A. To expedite project start-up,
IDA would retroactively finance project expenditures incurred after November
1, 1994 up to a limit of SDR 3.9 M (US$6.0 M equivalent). To facilitate



-8--
timely payment of project expenditures, a Special Account amounting to an
equivalent of US$4.0 million (equal to three months average disbursements)
would be established at the Reserve Bank of India. Proposed procurement
arrangements and disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B. A time table
of key processing dates and status of Bank Group operations in India are
attached as Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report
(No.13888-IN) is being distributed separately. Project completion date is
June 30, 2003 and closing date is December 31, 2003.
35.       Project Organization and Management.  Being multisectoral, the
project would be implemented by a number of departments and agencies. The
agricultural production commissioner (APC) would coordinate and guide these
departments and agencies in implementing project activities. Each
implementing department or agency would identify one officer who would be
responsible for coordinating all its activities under the project. To assist
the APC, a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) headed by a director and
supported by two economists, an environmentalist, an anthropologist and an
accounts officer would be established and supported under the project.
36.       At the grassroots level, participation of beneficiaries,
particularly women, NGOs, and farmers organizations, would be actively
promoted. To the extent possible, the project also would aim at transferring
or leasing production assets to the care and management of the local
beneficiary groups. Involvement of the GOA in activities better suited for
the private sector would be avoided. To achieve this objective the GOA would
create an economic environment conducive to the promotion of the private
sector in agriculture through policy adjustment as reflected in the policy
reform action plan (para 32).
37.       Environmental Impact.  An environmental analysis of the project was
carried out by reviewing each component using guidelines in the Bank's
Operational Directive 4.0. Based on this analysis, the project was
categorized as "B". The project would have an overall positive impact on the
environment through improvement of agricultural practices and land management.
The Project Implementation Unit would hire an environmentalist who would have
responsibility for developing and implementing guidelines for monitoring all
project activities for potential negative environmental impact and advising on
mitigating measures. If necessary, technical assistance would be sought from
government agencies in the state.
Impact on Women
38.       Women in Assam play a major role in agriculture and appear eager to
be involved in new income-generating activities, but they lack resources and
technical knowledge to initiate and sustain new enterprises. The GOA's
organized support services for women are largely directed toward welfare and
child care. In an effort to reverse the trend, socially oriented NGOs are
actively involved in training more women in the skills needed to participate
in economic activities. The need to create more jobs for women is even
greater in the wage labor market in Assam where they are poorly represented.
Of the total employment of 1 million at the end of March 1989, less than 0.3
million, or 30%, were women.
39.       Investments under the project such as improvement in the
infrastructure (rural roads), and the production of livestock, fish, fruits,
and vegetables would contribute to the welfare of women. Involving female



- 9-
beneficiaries in project planning, including selection of activities and their
location, would give them an opportunity to express their views on those
issues that affect them most.
40.       Sustainabilit .  Once completed, project activities would be
sustained. Incremental staffing would be kept to the minimum, and additional
recurrent costs would be within manageable limits. Most of the assets created
by the project would be transferred to the beneficiaries, who would operate
the assets and share the cost of operation and maintenance. Production assets
in horticulture, fisheries, and livestock would be supported through ongoing
research and extension services. Local NGOs would continue to support water
user groups in managing tube wells and ponds constructed under the project.
The improved policy environment, especially for marketing and processing,
would provide financial incentives for the groups to maintain their newly
acquired assets. Rural roads would be maintained by the GOA out of its state
budget; through the project, the GOA would have prepared a state policy and
financing arrangements for road repair and maintenance.
41.       Project Benefits.  The proposed project would contribute to the
GOA's objectives for poverty alleviation and would improve equity in the rural
areas. It also would accelerate agricultural growth through improved use of
resources. The policy reforms to be carried out through the project would
lead to the allocation of resources to high-priority investments for
agricultural and rural development.
42.       The proposed project would benefit about 300,000 poor rural people
by directly increasing their average annual net income from farming alone by
about 60%, from about Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,700. In addition, while improving the
community assets, the construction works would generate about 75 million man-
days of seasonal and nonfarm employment through the road, fisheries, and
irrigation infrastructure supported under the project. Furthermore, the
nutrition of the rural population would be improved through increased
production of fish, fruit and vegetables, and milk.
43.       Agreed Actions.  Agreements were reached at negotiations that GOA
would:
(a) ensure that project implementing departments/agencies maintain
separate accounts for all components supported under the project
and implement proposed audit arrangements;
(b) contract with NGOs selected according to criteria agreed with the
Association to participate in project activities;
(c) maintain a Project Implementation Unit with staffing and
responsibilities agreed with the Association;
(d) maintain the Project Guidance Committee and the Project
Coordination Committee with membership and responsibilities agreed
with the Association;
(e) prepare and submit to the IDA by the end of March of each year
starting in 1996 annual work plans and budgets for the project
satisfactory to the Association;
(f) carry out land acquisition and resettlement and rehabilitation of
any people affected under the project in accordance with
arrangements and procedures agreed with the Association;



-10-
(g) ensure that implementing departments' and agencies' staff interact
with beneficiaries and agree on the choice, location, design,
preparation, and implementation of activities supported by the
project; and
(h) carry out with the assistance of consultants, a mid-term review by
June 30, 1999, (end of the fourth year of project implementation)
and implement the recommendations of the review.
44.       Disbursement of Credit proceeds for rural road repair and
maintenance would be conditional to preparation of a road maintenance policy,
financing arrangements and an implementation plan satisfactory to the
Association.
45.       The project faces four major risks:
(a) Funding. Poor budgetary support could slow down implementation.
To minimize the risk, the GOA would submit an annual budget and
commit itself to improve cost recovery and establish adequate
financial control measures that would be monitored during project
implementation. Funding needed for O&M would be the responsibility
of the beneficiaries. Pace of implementation, quality of
construction, and delivery of services would be monitored by local
NGOs and reported to concerned agencies every six months.
(b) Policy Reform and Commitment. Timely and effective implementation
and adherence by the GOA to the agreed policy reforms are crucial
to the success of the project. To minimize the risk, tangible
proof of readiness to implement the reforms has already been
demonstrated in the preparation of the state agricultural strategy
paper and the steps already taken to implement the items described
in the policy matrix. Implementation of policy reforms would be
reflected in the GOA's annual work plans and budgets for Bank
review. There would be close Bank supervision to ensure that dated
covenants associated with the reforms are met. Despite the built-
in safeguards, however, implementation of policy reform could be
delayed or even modified due to political events. General
elections will be held in 1996, and the political scenario in the
country is changing fast. Announcements of populistic measures
involving hand-outs from public funds are increasing markedly. It
would be unrealistic to expect that Assam would not be influenced
by this political trend.
(c) Institutional Capacity. The success of the project depends on
active participation of local and national NGOs. There is the risk
that such participation may be slow to materialize, and government
bureaucracy may delay the transfer of new assets to the farming
communities. Also, institutional weakness could pose risks for
project implementation. Quality of works (construction and
maintenance of rural roads) could suffer from inadequate staffing,
supervision, and standard enforcement. To enhance quality of
construction, the project would provide technical assistance to
train and motivate staff.



-11-
(d) Security. The security situation in Assam may delay field visits,
implementation, and timely supervision and monitoring. Project
activities and investment programs would be restricted to areas
where security problems are minimal. Active involvement of
beneficiaries (FMCs, WUA, etc) in the decision-making process and
their ownership of the project should reduce the security risk.
46. Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
