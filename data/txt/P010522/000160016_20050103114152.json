DEV.", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Project ratings are as follows: Project\n            outcome is satisfactory; sustainability is likely;\n            institutional development impact is substantial; Bank\n            performance is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory. Several lessons were gleaned from this\n            project:   Clearly defined implementation modalities and\n            first year activities should be a part of project design and\n            preparation. Fully appraised and staffed project activities\n            ready for implementation should be available for review at\n            project appraisal, and should cover at least the first year\n            of project implementation. Project design should provide a\n            clear strategy on how the intended beneficiaries will be\n            identified, and how they will be involved in planning and\n            implementing project activities. Projects such as this one\n            need to give high priority to monitoring and evaluation and\n            ensure observations are evaluated quickly and feedback is\n            used effectively to modify project design and/or\n            implementation arrangements, when necessary. Supervision\n            team should adopt a flexible and process approach and take\n            corrective measures based on findings of the monitoring and\n            evaluation reports. Good project management and financial\n            management are key facilitating factors for successful\n            project implementation. Towards this, a dedicated and\n            efficient PIU can improve the project performance\n            dramatically. More radical reform of the extension system is\n            needed if farmers are to make best use of new\n            infrastructure, including decentralized planning and\n            funding, collaboration between line departments and\n            partnerships with the private sector. The ability of small\n            farmers to join farm mechanization groups is constrained if\n            access to commercial bank loans is not facilitated.\n            Privately owned and operated shallow tube wells are by far\n            the most efficient and cost effective irrigation method in\n            most areas of Assam. Fish production is a potentially good\n            source of income for marginal farmers and the landless, but\n            well targeted and appropriate market-linked extension and\n            follow-up training is essential to nurture participants and\n            ensure sustainability of both groups and investments.\n            Without adequate attention to animal nutrition and health,\n            and to milk marketing, upgrading of cattle will bring only\n            limited benefits to livestock producers. Building a\n            constituency for community participation takes time and\n            project design must plan for this. Nurturing and training of\n            Nongovernmental organizations is needed if the maximum\n            benefit is to be obtained from their involvement."}, "docdt": "2004-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
