                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objectives of the Project are to: (i) make cost effective and efficient transport available for the freight and passenger traffic in the Zambezi valley to
                         accelerate economic growth and reduce poverty in the sub-region; (ii) increase international traffic through the Beira Railway System; and (iii) ensure the
                         operational, managerial and financial sustainability of the Beira Railway System.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         There is no denying that there has been a significant delay in the implementation of works in spite of repeated assurances from the concessionaire at the top level to complete the
                         Sena Line rehabilitation as originally planned, and later as per the newly-agreed completion date. However, as of November 2010, when the last WB supervision mission took place,
                         the line was not ready yet to be handed over. The concessionaire argued in January and February 2011 that the rehabilitation is completed but some defects remain to be taken care

                         of, and the current capacity of the line and of the rolling stock fleet, makes it impossible for the concessionaire to attend the full transport demand. A a result, current traffic volumes,
                         and hence operating revenues, are significantly lower than planned at the time the concession was awarded and the project appraised.
