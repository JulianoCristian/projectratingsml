                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objectives of the Project are to: (i) make cost effective and efficient transport available for the freight and passenger traffic in the Zambezi valley to
                         accelerate economic growth and reduce poverty in the sub-region; (ii) increase international traffic through the Beira Railway System; and (iii) ensure the
                         operational, managerial and financial sustainability of the Beira Railway System.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         There is no denying that there has been a significant delay in the implementation of works. However, as of August 8, CCFB and Vale signed an agreement to start moving coal trains,
                         and the first train started from Moatize. Given the state of disrepair the line wasin prior to the project, The Bank considers the rehabilitation work a notable achievement, made
                         possible by the Conceding Authority's and CCFB's joint efforts.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Bank welcomes the recent significant achievements and the opening of the Sena Line to coal trains. However, in light of the difficulties faced so far by the project and of the
                         questions related to its future, the Bank team is still circumspect taking in to account that the project development objectives are still not fully met, and only time will tell whether rail
                         operations on this network will spur economic growth in the Zambeze Valley as expected and facilitate international trade with neighboring countries.
