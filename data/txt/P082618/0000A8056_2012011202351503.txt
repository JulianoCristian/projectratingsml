                         The objectives of the Project are to: (i) make cost effective and efficient transport available for the freight and passenger traffic in the Zambezi valley to
                         accelerate economic growth and reduce poverty in the sub-region; (ii) increase international traffic through the Beira Railway System; and (iii) ensure the
                         operational, managerial and financial sustainability of the Beira Railway System.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The rehabilitation work has been completed and a temporary agreement to transport coal along the Sena line is now in force. However, significant remedial work is needed on the
                         Sena line to make it safe for normal and safe operations. Also, due to insufficient maintenance and numerous derailments, the Machipanda line has deteriorated further and is in fact
                         in a worse condition than at the start of the project.

                         The relationship between the concessionaire and the conceding authority has broken down and the concession has been terminated by the Government of Mozambique. CFM took
                         over the management of the assets on December 7, 2011 from the existing concessionaire Rites/IRCON, and unless the parties can come to an amicable settlement, the project
                         termination seems to be heading for arbitration.
