The project\n            became effective on March 15, 2005. A restructuring approved\n            by the country director was completed in March 2009. The\n            project is scheduled to close on December 31, 2011. The\n            implementing entities are in full compliance with the\n            Bank's financial management requirements. Currently,\n            there are no overdue audit reports and interim financial\n            report from these entities.
