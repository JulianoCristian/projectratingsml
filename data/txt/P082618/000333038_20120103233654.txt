  2.      The Beira Railway Project is a US$158 million project with IDA contribution of
  US$110 million and foreign private commercial investment of US$48 million. The
  project became effective on March 15, 2005. A restructuring approved by the country
  director was completed in March 2009. The project is scheduled to close on December
  31, 2011. The implementing entities are in full compliance with the Bank’s financial
  management requirements. Currently, there are no overdue audit reports and interim
  financial report from these entities. The proposed reallocation is consistent with the
  Operation Policy (O.P) 13.05 and the Bank Procedures (B.P) 13.05 and complies with all
  the requirements.

  3.   The proposed reallocation is being requested before the project closes on
  December 31, 2011. This request corresponds to additional completion works that have

                                             1
been properly documented and assessed. It is being made possible by savings on
Companhia Caminhos De Ferro Da Beria - Beira Railway Company (CCFB) category 1
and 2.A (works, ballast and sleepers) of SDR3.6 million. This will allow for:

   •   the purchase of 3,000 tons of new 45Kg/m rail, for sections of the line that were
       not properly appraised at the initial stage of the survey: SDR2.1 million;
   •   full utilization of the initial contract value (SDR3.95 million) for the Project
       Implementation Unit: some of this contract value was used in the first reallocation
       but needs to be reinstated now: SDR1.39 million;
   •   the remaining balance is allocated to category 5 Portos e Caminhos de Ferro de
       Mocambique – Mozambique Ports and Railways Enterprise (CFM) component) to
       cover Project Accounting Section costs and technical assistance consultancy
       services: SDR0.11 million.

4.     The category 6, unallocated amount of SDR290,000 will be cancelled. The final
total SDR value of the project will be SDR75.31 million and the other component value
(category                   4)                  remains                   unchanged.
