"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Beira Railway Project\n            for Mozambique were as follows: outcomes were\n            unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome was substantial;\n            Bank performance was unsatisfactory and borrower performance\n            was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            includes: consider carefully the level of Government\n            shareholdings in concessions. Though consideration was\n            rightly given to the political and economic environment at\n            the time of the concession, the Government of\n            Mozambique's (GoM's) 49 percent stake in the\n            concession created conflicting interests between the\n            Government's roles of policy maker, regulator, and\n            client on the one hand, and shareholder on the other.\n            Consider effective regulatory body. This will help in\n            limiting direct Government involvement in operations and\n            focus the role of Government on regulatory control and\n            policy making. Ensure clear separation between rail\n            operations and infrastructure management. The Beira Railway\n            Project might have had a different outcome if the links\n            between the rail and port modes were clearly seen as part of\n            an efficient logistics link targeting the major users."}, "docdt": "2012-07-27T00:00:00Z"}
