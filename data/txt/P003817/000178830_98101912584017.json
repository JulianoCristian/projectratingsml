future transmigration settlements by locating\n            migrants in suitable areas and by ensuring sufficient lead\n            time to permit adequate planning and coordination among\n            implementing agencies; (b) a 2,000 families settlement\n            component adjacent to the first Bank-assisted project site\n            in Baturaja, South Sumatra, and needed services and\n            facilities in the existing settlement; and (c) a component\n            to assist the transmigration program development. The latter\n            component will focus on: (i) improving staff training in the\n            Directorate General of Transmigration (DGT); (ii) expanding\n            agricultural research in support of transmigration under the\n            Agency for Agricultural Research and Development (AARD); and\n            (iii) providing technical assistance to the Minister for\n            Development Supervision and Environment (MDSE) to monitor\n            and improve the ecological soundness of transmigration projects."}, "docdt": "1983-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
