AP?RAISAL OF A. SECCND EDUGATION PRCEFCT ZJN TAN ZLVIA
SU1T4ARY
i.        The Tanzanian Government requested financial assistance for an
education project estimated to cost about US$11.4 million. During appraisal
the project was modified to cost about US$7.2 million. This project would
follow a first credit of US$4.6 million, made in 1963, for general secondari%
schools and satisfactorily completed in 1967.
ii.       The recommended project meets urgent and high priority needs in
the education system.  It comprises the construction and equipment of:
(a) one new secondary school for a total enrolment of 600 pupils;
(b)  extensions to 24 secondary schools providing 3,500 additional
places and specialized facilities for 10,880 pupils;
(c)  extensions to the Dar es Salaam Teacher TDraining College for
80 additional teacher trainees;
(d) extensiorns to two primary teacher training colleges to increase
enrolments by 730.
iii.      The proposed project would promote the teaching of agricultu.ral,
technical and commercial subjects in 25 secondar-y schools and agricultural
subjects in two primary teacher tzaining colleges.  It would conform to
Governmuent's conprehensive plan for educational development and to projecte6
needs for skilled manpower.
iv.       There would be sufficient qualified applicants for the additional
places to be provided in the project schools.  Teacher supply would also
be sufficient if ttLe Government m.akes arrangements to maintain the preea2nt
teaching force or obtain suitable replacements.
r.        Schedules of accommodation, furrxiture and equipment lists and
est imates of cost are satisfactory.  Contracts for civi- worksk, furniture
and equipment procurement would be awarded on the basis of Interna1o:ut    .
competitive bidding.  Consulting architect,s would be retained to undercaoe
the design and supeirvision of construction work involved in the proposed
project.  Technical assistance would 'e provided by the Governr=ent to
support developments in specialist teacher training and agri-ultural atreaxrs
in secondary schools.
vi.       The project is suitable as a basis for an IDA crexLt oif US$5.0
million which is nearly 70%t of the estimated total project cost. The
credit would provide for the foreign excharnge componernt, estimated at
US$3.3 million and US$1.7 million of local currency. The recurrent ex-
penditure created by the project, amounting to about US$2.0 million, ad
capital contribution are within the capacity of the Governmernt.






APPRAISAL OF A SECt2  EDUCATICI  PRJECT Th `ANZALIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In December, 1963, a first development credit for education was
made to Tanzania (then Tanganyika). The credit, amounting to $4.6 million
and entirely for the development of general secondary schools, was fully
withdrawn before the Closing Date, December 31, 1967. No significant
problems were met during implementation and the schools which it helped to
finance are in operation.
1.02      The Tanzanian Gover-ent applied to the International Development
Association for a second credit to help finance the construction and equip-
ment of four new and additions to 26 general secondary schools, two new and
additionis to three primary teacher training colleges and additions to the
Dar es Sa:Laam Technical College, requaired for the countryts education ex-
pansion program as envisaged in the two five-year Develoment P'ans for
1964-69 and i969-74. An appraisal mission visited Tanzania duririg May-June
1968. Its members were Messrs. R. F. M&!iahlon (technical education), K. M.
Thint (architect), J. 14. Holley (agricultural education), 1. A. M4enezes
(econamist) and -W. D. Donnelly (general education).
1.03      A Bank econ<mic m;ission visited Tanzania in 1967, reviewed the
1964-69 Development Plan and assessed progress in its implementation. ItS
report (INTo. AF-58b) was distributed to the Executive Directors or, Octolber
16, 1967.  In particular, Voluae ITI, Part 7, on education served as a use-
ful guide to the mission in its appraisal of Tanzania's present application.
IL.04     A Unesco mis sion visited Tanzania during November 1965 - 1ay 1966
to survey and conpile an inventor:r of exdsting secondary school facilities.
Its report indicates that the teaching space capacity in secondary schools
was not then fully ut-lized and that the schools could accomruodate an ada-
tiorxal enrolment of about 20%. 7his surlplus capacity ;.as, over the 1s
three years, been partly absorbed by increased enrolments vut available
space has been taken into account in planning the proposed project, thereby
reducing the volume of teaching space needed for the expansion.
1.05      Stady by the Barnk of the proposect pro-ec-tv was aiLed cy yata frQa 9
a manpowrer survey carried out, with Ford FoundatiLon assistance, by the
I4anpower Planning Unit of the Directorate of Development and Plarining.
Evaluation of the data indicated that all itens in the proposed projje&J
except part of the proposals for expanding primary teacher  ,raillre Vole eo
and the equipment for professional engineer courses at the k-.- eS !
Technical College could be justified. However, the proposals amitted a6n, -
cultural, comercial and technicaL subjects frwo  the  =rr2cu a of seconcr
schools.  These subjects are now to be incuded, following discussions
between the Tanzanian Govenmaent and the appraisal mission   Bec&ase no
facilities for training teachers of these suojects exist in Tanzania, t
was also agreed with the Government that provisZ.on for such training facfli-
ties and for technical assistance to help establish the facl ties should
be included in the revised project.



1 .C6     Subsequent to the receipt of rhe Tanzanian Goverrinentfs request,
the Governments of Dermark and Norway have urdertaken to finance three of
the four new general secondary schools included in the request.  Also, tao
very small general secondary school expansions were deleted from the proJec...
The project has therefore been reduced by elirminating three new general
secondary schools, additions to one primary teacher training college, the
advanced equipment requested for the Technical College and by exparding 21
instead of 26 secondary schools; it has been increased by supplying teacher
training facilities as indicated in the previous paragraph.
II. SOCIAL AND ECON011C BACKGROUND
Country and People
2.01      The mainland of Tanzania has a population of about 12.2 million Ln
an area of 362,000 sqaare miles, the density averaging only 34 persons per
square mile. Most of the population are engaged in subsistence farming.
The village systes, common in manay developing countries, has not evolved iz
Tanzania where people live usually in 3nal1 groups separated by long dis-
tances. This charactei4stic, together with poor ca:mAnications, has made
the organizatio. of community services difficult, particularly in regard to
the development of education and has required the provision of student
boarding and staff houses at most secondary schools.
Labor Force,   l noyament and Educati on
2.02      Agriculture is the counry, ys principal economic activity, accou:at-
ing for over ha!2 of domestic producoiorn, Cottorn, sisal and coffee are the
main- cash crops.
2.03      in 196,5  Tanxzania :iad a labor force of about 3.8 million, 42% oi'
which was female. The labor fccrce is rela.I-vey young and in urban areas
is almost exclusi-aely mae, An estimated 4% of the labor force are un-
employed.
2.04      Despite rising econar.ic gzo- ht -here was a marked drop in wage
enployment in the 3recent past.  tiJ  96$  tne estimated total number of wag'e
eamers was 336,500 (8% of eslarate': 12or norce) as against 412,000 iLn
1961ij a drop of 18%. Mlost of the decrease was in the private sector a1iJc
appears to have, resulted fran a rapid 3C ase in wages wivdich stimulated
eamployers to aopt lbov-si-v_g  Ieé<*i  Sde;iiistics for  967 shfow thaiv

Development and Manpower Planning
2.05      Development planning in Tanzania was initiated shortly before
independence in 1961. Following a 3-year plan, a 5-year Economic
Development Plan (1964-69) was adopted which remains the target for
economic, manpower and educational development. V4hilst it is too early
to assess the final degree of implementation of the Plan, it is now
apparent that many of the desired targets will not be attained. In the
production of trained manpower, for example, the output of qualified
professional personnel is likely to reach only about 50% of the target..
The general shortage of skilled and experienced personnel is one of the
main reasons why implamerntatiori of the Plan will fall below early expec-
tations.
2.06      The Goverrment is preparing a second 5-year Economic Develop-
ment Plan (1969-74); a first draft is expected early in 1969. Pre-
liminary indications are that high priority will continue to be given
to education and greater emphasis placed on productive activities such
as agriculture. Completion of the Plan depends upon certain decisions,
including the expansion rate of primary schools and the degree of
training of teachers to be employed therein. These decisions would
determine the cost of primary education and the expansion needs at
primary teacher training colleges and secondary schools.
Economic Situation
2.07      In spite of adverse weather conditions irn 1961, 1965 and
1967, Tanzarniats economic growth, although below the planned target
rate of 6.81Z per annum, has increased at about 5.5% per annum since
1961.  Howeve   gross domestic product per capita is still very low,
only $66 in 1967 (provisional figure).
2.08      An encouraging feature of development has been tie rapid
expansion of manufacturing industry. Output increased by over 16%
per year between 1961 and 1966 and, given the required investment and
skilled manpower, is expected to expand at this rate for some years.
2.09      Prospects for economic growth over the next few years appear
to be good ana GDP at constant prices may rise at an average rate of
about 5Wß annually.  Implicit in this forecast is the assumption that
an adequate supply of trained manpower wil' be available to meet the
development needs of agriculture, commerce and industry.

III. EDUCATICt AND TRAGINflIG
The itiinistration of Education
3.01      The Minister of Education is responsible for primary, secondary,
technical and higher education whether provided by Govermnent, local educa-
tion authorities, voluntary agencies or private bodies. Schools which
receive Goverment financial help are usually referred to as "assisted"
schools to distinguish them frcm "unassisted" or private schools. Ministrv
headquarters staff includes a Principal Secretary as chief administrative
officer, a Chief Education Officer (C.E.O.) supported by Assistant C.E.Os.
responsible for primary, secondary and technical education, teacher train-
ing, planing and the inspectorate. Primary education is controlled by 17
Regional Education Officers operating through 75 District Education Officers.
Principal Assistant Secretaries are responsible for higher education and
for finance and establishments (Annex 1).
3.02      The Ministry is well organized in general but there is an urgent
need for specialist staff to develop agricultural and technical education.
The inspectorate is undermanned and needs reinforcing to cover agricultural.
cimercial and technical subjects. Assurances were obtained during nego-
tiations that the Government will augment the inspectorate and appoint
qualified officials to caver agricultural and technical education.
General Education - Primary and Secondary
3.03      The structure of education (Annex 2) comprises seven years of
primary (Standards 1 to 7), four years of secondary (Forms 1 to 4) and two
of pre-university (Forms 5 and 6). Primary education is given in Swahili
but Ehglish is taught throughout. All post-primary instruction is in
English. After canpleting Form 4, pupils sit for the Cambridge University
School Certificate and at the end of Form 6 for the Higher School Certifi-
cate.
3.04     .in the six years 1961-67 enrolments in the 4,500 assisted primary
schools have increased from nearly 500,000 to over 750,000 representing
about 50% of the eligible age group (Annexes 3 and 4). A promotion exmi-
nation at Standard 4 allows about 50% of pupils to continue to Standard 5.
Primary school children pay fees of 120 shillings per year but no fees are
paid for post-primary education. EnroLments in private primary schools
total about 5% of the assisted primary school enrolment.
3.05      In the six years 1961-67 overall enrolm:ents in assisted secondary
schools have more than doubled to over 25,000 whilst enrolments in the
pre-university two-year course have qcadrupled itv l7, 700 &Annex 5).  Even
so, these figures represent only 2,5% of the  18 years age goup,  Com-
parative figures for scme other African countr-es are as f?oj1lows;

Enrolments in unassisted secondary schools are 17% of assisted secondary
school enrolment.
3.06      In 1967, 72% of pupils in secondary schools were boarders. The
need for boarding facilities arises from the low population density which
prevents the great majority of children from attending school as dar
pupils.              In addition, secondary school pgpils require facilities
for study which are provided in boarding schools but which are lacking in
most African homes. The perfonnarace of boarding school puapils in terminal
exa,minataions is considerably better than that of day students whAich provides
a supporting arguient for incurring the additionaL cost of boarding places,
3.07      The quality of primarxy schools is reasonable and high st andards
are generally attained in the upper forms of secondary schools. h;owever,
teaching of physical science subjects could be improved by concentrating
the teaching of these subjects into selected secondary schools.
Technical Education
3.03      The two secondary technlical schools, at Moshi and lfunda, proviae
14-year post-primary courses which have ar engineering bias 'ut lead to
School Certificate.  The present enrolment of 870 stuadents is planned t.
rise to 1,150 by 1971 with the main development at Iloshi where additions -co
include Forms 5 and 6 leading to Higher School Certificata would boe made,
3.09      Trade training is the responsibilIt.y of the linistry of abor
has recently signed an agreement with tNDP to init.tIwe a Nsational industr.la;
Apprenticeship Scheme project.  The project, to be executed by ILO, wiil
last 5 years and have an output of about 200 craftsmen per year from 19?`
The UNDP financial allocation is 'JS$764,000 anrd the Governmient contribui.-Lon
Us$890o,000.
3.10      The Army operates a National Service Training Schere 2or selecß;
personnel campleting National Service.  Two hundred and thirty four pers.onnel
are now in trade training on courses generally of two years duration.   .
capacity of the Scheme is 300 trainees so that an annual output o' abouta
140 is to be exPected by 1970. The Scheme is effect.ively led and adminis-
tered and operates closely with industry.



-6-
3.11      Numerous short specialized courses for operatives and ccmmercial
workers are provided by Government departments and industrial concerns,
No reliable figures for enrolments are available but one estimate for 1968
puts the total at 3,000. Considerable economies in operating costs and
improvements in the efficiency of these courses could be attained if basic
agricultural, camercial and industrial training weregiven in secondary
schools.
3.12      The only institute for higher technical education in Tanzania
is the Dar es Salaam Technical College which operates full-time commercial
and engineering courses at technician level. Students completing these
courses total about 50 in engineering and 50 in commerce annually but enrol-
ment is well below the capacity of the College. Evening courses in commerce
and engineering are also available. USAID provides technical assistance in
the form of a 7-man team of instructors from California Polytechnic, which
has been in the College for about 3 years and expects to stay a further 4
years. The Government is considering a development of the College to
include the training of engineering technologists, probably in cooperation
with Dar es Salaam University College. In planning the courses, special
emphasis is being placed on training students for the special needs of
Tanzania.
3.13      Training of engineering technologists naw takes place at the
Nairobi University College or overseas but the supply is inadequate and
their training is not always appropriate to employment opportunities in
Tamani a.
Agricultural Education
3.l14     Since 195lmanyprimary schools have had gardens in which pupils
learn rudimentary agriculture but very few teachers have had any agricul-
tural training. It is intended that future training of primary school
teachers will include agricultural subjects as saitable teacher educators
becane available frcm the primary teacher training colleges.
3.15      Since 1966, three secondary schools have taught agricultural
subjects but expansior into other schools has not been possible due to lack
of teachers.
3.16      Two agricultural training institutes, at Ukiriguru and Nyegezi,
are operated by the Ministry of Agriculture. The course is of two years
duration after completion of Form 4. M4ost of the output of 250 graduates
per year are employed as extension workers.
3.17      Morogoro Agricultural College has a 3-year diplorma course after
campletion of Form 4. The output of 50 per year is absorbed into Govrirnnent
employment. In 1969 the College, in conjunction *tiith the, IDar es Salaam
University College, will offer a degree course éir agrJiculiurte with an anual
intake of 80 by 1971.  In the meantime, Tanzanians atte.ld agre.cultural
degree courses at Makerere University College i.n Uganda.

The University of East Africa
3.18      Bast Africa's only university has three constituent colleges at
Makerere in Uganda, Nairobi in Kenya and Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, each
with specialized faculties. In 1970, it is expected that each college will
become a serate university.  Faculties of Arts, Law, Science and an
Institute of Education are well established at Dar es Salaam, a Faculty of
Medicine was established in 1968 and a Faculty of Agriculture will be
established at Morogoro in 1969. In conjunction with the Technical College
(para. 3.12), consideration is being given to developing a Faculty of
Engineering in 1971. Present enrolment in the Dar es SaLam University
Colloge totaJsabout 1,000 and is planned to rise to 2,400 by 1975 (Annex 6).
Teacher Training
3.19      In 1967, there were 16,300 primary school teachers of whom 1,400
were Grade 'Al       ( two years teacher training following completion of
Forn 4), 1,700 Grade 'B' (two years teacher training following Fonm 2),
12,200 Grade IC' (two years teacher training following completion of
Standard 7) and 1,000 unqualified. It is the Government's policy to replace
Grade IC' teachers with Grade 'A' as rapidly as feasible. The 1969 output
of the present 15 teacher training colleges will be 700 Grade 'Al and 600
Grade IC' teachers.  Full-time training of Grade 'Bt teachers has ceaseds
but a scheme of in-service training enables Grade IC' teachers to become
Grade 'B' teachers.
3.20      In 1967, there were 1,230 secondary school teachers as follows:
Tanzanian Citizens                  Non-Tanzanians
Graduate Teachers     120           British           3h5
Diplana Teachers       65           Peace Corps       160
Grade 'A' (primary                  Canadians          30
training only)      165           Others (mainly
Others                 35             Asians)         310
385                             845
Of 1,230 secondary school teachers, only 185 or 15% of the total are trained.
Tanzanians.  The pupil/teacher ratio is low - 21/1 in 1967 - and. in view
of the relative inexperience of the Tanzanian teachers who, during the next
few years, are expected to replace the overseas teachers, it is not intended
to increase this ratio immediately.
3.21      Diploma qualified teachers for Forms 1 to 4 are trdaed for two
years, after obtaining Higher School Cert4ficate, at the Chang'ombe (Dar es
Salaam) Teacher Training College where the annual output is about 70 per
year. Graduate teachers are trained at the Dar es Salaam University College
in a three-year course after completing Higher School Certificate; output
is expected to average about 150 per year during the next five years.



3.22      No facilities exist for the training of agricultural, cowsercial
or technical teachers.
Educatimal lRdio and Television
3.23      Hadio Tanzania broadcasts 12 hours of radio programs weekly for
primary schools and 10 hours for secondary schools.  The languages of in-
str.ctimn are Swahili for primary schools and English for secondary schools.
Sabjects covered for secondary schools include English, history, civics and
science. There is no national television service and none is planned for
the immediate future, mainly because of the expense involved.
IV. FINANCING EDUCATICN
Past and Present Education Ependituxe
4.01      The development of total educational expenditures in relation to
total central Goverrment expenditures for the seven years 1962/63 to 1968/62
(Annex 7 and Table 1) indicates that education expenditures have kept within
reasonable limits. Although total education expenditures increased by about
30% during the five years 1964/65 to 1968/69, they have remained nearly
constant at about 5% of GDP.

from 61% to 55% in the proportion of total recurrent expenditure spent
on primary education. Viewed from an economic aspect, this is a
desirable trend because it has enabled finance to be allocated to sec-
ondary and higher education in increased proportions. However) the high
rate at which expenditure at the University College has risen should not
be further continued and the Government is exploring ways of stabilizing
the College's expenditures.

F&iture Education Expenditure
4.03      Tansania's second 5-year Econamic Development Plan (1969-74) is
under preparation and is expected to be conpleted early in 1969. It is
too early at present to anticipate its contents so the Bank has made
projections (Table 3 and Annex 9 ) of education expenditures to 1978/79.
The basis for these projections is that the future growth of GDP would be
594 annually. It is also assumed that total central Government recurrent
expenditure will rise at 8% annually, that central Government recurrent
expenditure on education would remain at about 20% of total central Govern-
ment recurrent expenditure and that the contributios to educatimo af Local
Authorities and Voluntary Agencies would increase at 1.5% annually.

those recommended by the Treasury to the 1Ninistry of Education for use in
preparing the education plan for inclusion in the second 5-year Economic
Development Plan. Given reasonable and continued overall economic develop-
ment in Tanzania, the Governmient should be able to support the educational
expenditures shown.

V. 1DUCATICN AND TRADIING NEEDS
Secondarz Schools - The Quantitative Need
5.01      At the end of 1965 the total Tanzanian working population was
estimated at 3.8 million of whan about half had received no formal educa-
tion, 15% had canpleted primary education, 1% had cmpleted secondary
school to Form 4 and about 0.15% had attended university for one or more
years. Hence, the Tanzanian labor force is characterized by a very low
level of education for African workers and a predcminance of non-Africans
in positions where advanced levels of education are required. Most posi-
tions requiring graduates of universities and post-secondary irstitutes
are filled by foreigners; this is particularly the case for teachers in
the upper fonrs of secondary schools and at the University College where
mainly Peace Corps and British contract personnel are found.
5.02      A survey of high level manpower requirements and resources for
the Five Year Devblopment Plan, 1964/65 to 1968/69, was carried out b:
the Manpower Planning Unit of the Directorate of Development and ?lanaLng
in 1964. This survey is now being revised and projected to cover the
period 1969-79; canpletion is expected early in 1969. Interim resulhca are
given in Annex 10. The projections assume that GDP (at constant prices)
Will grow at 6.8% annually and the annual increase in productivity of
labor is taken at 3%. Because both these figures are thought to be high,
their net result may be approx:imately correct.  T"he projections have tn>
fore been accepted as illustrative of the need for skilled manpower.
5.03      The interim results, based upon the Government's projections.,
estimate that during 1969-79 the average incremental need per anxnun for
various categories of workers are:
Average annual need for skilled manpower (1969-79)
Professional                       (Category A)      6>u
Sub-professional                   (Category B)   l1,45G
Skilled office and manual workers (Category C)    2,50G
Total annual need        ____
This need increases from about 3,660 in 1969 to 4,820 in 1975.



- 12 -
5.04      The basic source of sup;Sy for the above total need is the outpuil
from secondary schools at Form 4, subsequent training of about five years
being required to qualify for Category A employment, two years to qualify
for Category B employment and up to one year as Category C workers. The
Civil Service and para-statal organizations together employ about 80% of
Categories A, B and C manpower in Tanzania and it is a requirement that
entrants into training schemes for these categories should have passed the
School Certificate examination, a qualification obtained by about 60% of
those completing Form 4. Those who fail to obtain a School Certificate seek
employment in lower level occupations.
5.05      Taking into account the above factors and allowing that one-half
of entrants into Category C employment in the private sector should have
a School Certificate, then a balance of need against supply would be:
Actual Numbers Completing       Required Numbers Completing

under construction.
g/ 60% of total completing Form 4.
y(  87% of output .with School Certificate to allow for girls who do not join
the labor force.
5.o6      These projections indicate the need to increase the output from
Form 4 to about 9,200 to meet a shortfall rising to 1,800 in 1975. The
required output fram Form 4 would be obtained by increasing secondary school
enrolments from 26,000 to 38,000 which would raise the proportion of the
relevant age group attending Forms 1-4 fram 2VI in 1968 to about 3Ω%.
5.07      Outputs from Forms 6 are intended, with subsequent training, to
meet requirements for all Category A and about 20% of Category B workers, i.e,
for an average annual need of 950 workers during 1969-79. The prerequisites
for training these workers are passes in appropriate subjects at the Higher
School Certificate exmTiinations.  Of students completing Form 6, about 50%
fail to reach the required standard in. H.S.C examinatiorm to qualify them
for training for Category A or the upper echelon of Category B work. Conse-
quently, outputs from Form 6 schooLs should be expanded to about 1,900 student.z
yearly from the expected output of 1,200 in 1969 by adding some 1,500 ne-
student places in Forms 5 and 6.

Secondary Schools - The Qualitative Need
5.08      The traditional role of Tanzanian secondary schools has been to
provide courses principally directed towards educating pupils for entryj to
university, little regard being paid to the wide opportunities available
to pupils not gaining university entrance. The Government appreciates the
weakmess of such traditional courses and now plans to diversify the secofd-
ary school curriculum so that all pupils will follow courses in either
agricultural, comercial or technical subjects, thus increasing school
leavers prospects of imediate and useful emiployment.
5.09      To reduce the failure rate in School Certificate examinationst
teacher training programs are being expanded at the Institute of  '.ucwior
but it is likely to be several years before these programs have an impact
on the schools. The failure rate is also likely to be reduced by the
introduction of East African School Certificate examinations, more appro-
priate to pupils' background and experience.  During negotiations tho
Gverment gave an assurance that it would expedite develojent of this ne%
examination system.
The Need for Primary `k,hool Teachers
5.10      During 1969-79 it is proposed to increase enroln2ents in prim.--y
schools at the rate of 5% analy4 vihich, clue to a growing population,
would result in an incroase in the proportion of the age groupa enrolle¢
frca 50% in 1969 to about 60% in 1979. Zaintaining the present Pupil
teacher ratio of about 45/1, this expansion calls for an increase in -rhe
number of teachers frcLm 17,i000 in -1968 to 27,000 i  1978.   , oWinrg 3%
annual wastage for retirement, etc., the average annual output from pri.azary
teacher training colleges should therefore be about 1,,650 teachers. The
1969 output from existing teacher training colleges will be about 1i,300
with a resulting deficit of 350 teachers. This can be niet oy expandi7'7
two teacher training colleges.

Tke &-erage capital cost (excluding site work cost, professional fec' and
uralloca:'ed) per student place in the new secondary school is US$530 for
instructional facilities and $410 for boarding facilities. The foreign ex-
ct'ange component amounts to about 46% of the total. The increase in annual
recurrent expenditure created by the project is estimated at US$2.0 million
or about 8% of Ministry of Educationls present recurrent expenditure.  During
tiiplementation of the proposed project, the maximn  contribution by the
Government towards its capital cost in any year will be about US$0.8 million
-;-hich is about 3% of present Ministry of Education total expenditure. These
capital and recurrent costs generated by the project are considered to be
ithin the Govermnent's cpacity.            Ccmpletion of the project is expected
to take Wg years (Annex 13).
.econdary Schools - New and  EXtensions
6.03      The increases in student places and student outputs resulting hro
the one new school and expansion of 24 schools are:
Increased           Increased
Student Places       Annual Output (est.)
Forms 1-4              2,460                600
Forms 5-6              1,64Q0               600
1/  Of these, 400 are to replace unsatisfactory temporary accommodation.
tilowing for girls not joining the labor force and failures at 3chool Cer-
tificate examinations, the increased arnual output of 600 from Form 4 would
yield about 250 qualified for further training to become Category A, B or C
workers. This output is about 63% of the average shortfall of supply over
demand for the years 1968-73 (para. 5.05). The remaining shortfall is to be
-i-iet by the output from 3 new schools which are to be built with assistance
'rom Denmark and Norway (para. 1.06). The additional output from Form 6 of
600 students yearly is about 85% of the expansion indicated frcm the manpowFer
Lnalysis (para. 5.07). Cn a qualitative basis, 500 of the graduates should
have studied science and 100 arts. The shortfall will be met by the  3 new
schools referred to above.
6 .04     The proposed expansion in Forms 1-4 woulci increase enrleients Zrorr;
6,000 in 1968 to 28,460 by about 1973 and result in a modest increase Ln
tne proportion of the relevant age group attending Forms 1-4  from  ibout2" 2
to 2.7%, a proportion wnich is below that of many countries in a comparable
state of development (para. 3.05).
6.05      The supply of teachers of agricultural, commercial, and. technica]-
Lbjects for Foims 1-h is dealt with below in paras. 6.06 and 6.10.  The
present and projected enrolments for teacher training at the Dar es Salaam
∂ieacher Training College and the University College Institute of Education
,Annex 6) indicate that the long-term prospects for providing secondary



- 16 -
schools with qualified Tanzanian arts and science teachers are good.  Irn
the meantime, the dependence on expatriate teachers will continue. In this
conmection, it is likely that the supply of teachers from U.K. to Tanzania
may gradually decrease as a result of disagreement between the two Govern-
ments over payment of pensions to British colonial civil servants who
retired in the service of the pre-independence Tanganyika government.
Also, all U.S. Peace Corps teachers in secondary schools were withdrawn
at the end of 1968. A large reduction in the number of foreign teachers
would seriously impair the efficiency of the secondary schools. It is
anticipated, however, that replacement teachers can be recruited frcm such
countries as Canada and India. During negotiations the Government gave an
assurance that a sufficient number of suitably experienced teachers would
be available to staff the secondary schools.
Extensions to the Dar es Salaam Secondary Teacher Training College
6.06      This College, built with assistance from USAID during the last
five years (para. 3.21), is not yet fully developed. It is proposed to
expand it by adding two sections to train teachers of commerce and tech-
nical subjects on two-year post Higher School Certificate diploma courses
by providing a workshop, a commerce room and boarding facilities.  Each
section would have an enrolment of 40 students to give an annual output
of nearly 20 teachers who would be employed in secondary schools, the
Technical College and in Government training establishments. This output
would enable cammercial or technical subjects to be included gradually in
all secondary schools during the next 10 years.
Extensions to Primary Teacher Training Colleges
o.C7      To meet the need for primary school teachers (para. 5.10) the two
primary teacher training colleges at Korogwe and Kotoke would be expanded,
by providing classrooms, agricultural facilities, equipment, boarding
facilities and staff housing. Their present combined total enrolment of
230 would thus be increased to 960.  This would increase the total output
by about 350 teachero yearly, enable agricuitural subjects to be included
in thle c;urricul-m and improve operational efficiency by raising the size
o" each college.  it would also he!p to upgrade the general level of
teachers in primary schools by vraiing Grade "Al" teachers to replace
Grade 'IC" teachers (para. 3.19>   To support expanision of primary teacher
training colleges. 32 addlitiona>. teacher educrators would be required durirg

rechnlcal Assistance and Fellowships
S.09      Because the local staff lack experience, ten specialists in agri-
cultural, commercial and technical education, with qualifications and
experience satisfactory to the Association, are essential to assist in the
setting up of teacher training facilities in these subjects and to support
initial developments in agriculture in four secondary schools. Ten oversea3
fellowships are necessary to train counterpart staff to replace the spe-
cialists.
6.10      Training of teachers of agriculture would take place at a suitab:IJC
agricultural college in Tanzania to which a specialist in agricultural edu-
cation would be assigned for 4 years.  The annual output of teachers of
agriculture from this course should be about 20 per year and would enabie
agricultural subjects to be gradually included in all secondary schools and
primary teacher training colleges during the next 10 years. Of the fmirteer.
secondary schools in which agricultural subjects would be introduced in
the proposed project an agricultural specialist would be assigned to each
of 4 schools for 3 years so that these schools may serve as standards for
other schools. To coordinate the agricultural training programs at the
agricultural college, the secorndary schools and primary teacher trairL-rg
colleges, a qualified and experienced agricultural educationalist would b0e
attached to the Ministry of Education for 4 years.  Overseas £ellowships
each of two years duration, to train six counterparts for the agricultural
specialists are included in the project.
6.11      To support teacher training in commercial and technicial subjects
at the Dar es Salaam Teacher Training College, four specialists, two in each
of these subjects, are required, each for three years; four counterparts
to replace the specialists would be trained on 2-year courses overseas.
6.12      The technical assistance and fellowships necessary to support
the proposed project are:
Man-years
For agricultural teaching development:
Cne coordinator at Ministry of Education                 4
One expert at an agricultural college                    4
Four experts at secondary schools                       12
Six fellowships                                         12
For Dar es Salaam Teacher Training College:
Two experts in Technical Education
Two experts in Commercial Education                      6
Four fellowships                                         8
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Governn=ent ;waz
rovide or obtain the technical assistance indicated above and that the
expertst qualifications and experience and the training provided for
1'ellows would be acceptable to the Association.

Accazmodation and BquipMent
6.13      Accommodation schedules for each school and college have been
reviewed and revised to acceptable standards and the estimated costs are
considered reasonable. Preliminary equipment and furniture lists, adequate
for cost estimating, have been examined; final equipment lists will be
submitted to the Association for approval after the experts indicated in
para. 6.12 have been appointed.
VII.  IMPLEMENTATICN OF THE PROJECT
Administration
7.01      To implement the proposed project, a Project Unit would be set up
in the Ministry of Education headed by a full-time Project Director and would
include an experienced and competent architect, an educator knowledgeable
in school construction and administration and an official experienced in
accounting and auditing procedures. During negotiations an assurance was
obtained that initial appointments, and any changes, to the posts of Project
Director and architect would be subject to approval by the Association.
The Project Unit would have necessary supporting staff to carry out prepa-
ration of (i) educational specifications for the teaching accommodation;
(ii) architectural briefs for the consultants; and (iii) final fmrniture
and equipment lists.
7.02      During negotiations an assurance was obtained that the Ministry
of E1ucation would employ consultants acceptable to the Association for the
desiga and supervision of the project. Superintendence of the works would
be provided by the Public Works Division through the regional engineers and
the Project Unit would coordinate activities of the consultants, Public
liorks Division and the Treasury.
7.03      International competitive bidding would be used for the supply of
all equipment and furniture and for the construction of the schools.  Items
would be grouped to the maximum extent practicable to form sizeable bid
packages and to permit bulk procurement. Procedures for prequalification
of contractors and selection of consultants would be acceptable to the
Association.
7.o4      Administrative and financial procedures would be established for
the proper maintenance of the buildings. During negotiations assurances
were obtained that adequate funds would be provided for satisfactory main-
tenance of the schools and supplies of education materials.

Building Construction
7.05      The standards of building construction and design vary con6ider-
ably throughout the country. Secondary schools also show a variety of
architectural quality, ranging from the simplest shelters of steel sheet
and timber roof with masonry or mud walls to more sophisticated reinforced
concrete structures. In the main they are modest buildings with little
evidence of waste and generally in keeping with the stringent economic
requirements. Architectural and engineering practice follow acceptable
procedures.
7.06      In recent years the total building industry's activity has
remained fairly constant in relation to GDP, 1.4p in 1960 to 1.5% in 1966.
Building costs are expected to rise at the rate of 5% yearly during the
next 4 years and an allowance for this has been included in the cost esti-
mates for the proposed project.
7.07      A large proportion of building materials is imported and some of
the materials locally manufactured require a high component of imported raw
materials; this is also true for school furniture. Construction equipment)
sanitary and electrical fixtures and practically all specialized instruc-
tianal equipment are imported.
7.08      Secondary school construction and inaintenance are administered by
Government through the Public Works Division of the Ministry of Communica-
tions and Works who employ the services of private architects from time
to time.  There are about a dozen architectural and 100 building contractir:.
firms active in Tanzania. The Public W1orks Division keeps up-to-date lists
of approved contractors from which their tender lists are selected. There
is a good geographic distribution of capable contractors in the regians
where the project schools would be built. Tendering is normally public ard`
advertised in the local press. Bids are considered by the central tendcr
committee; the lowest evaluated bid is usually accerjed.
7.09      Suitable land is available for expansion of all schools En the
proposed project and no land costs are included in the cost estimates.
7.10      The building and commissioning of the schools are phased for
campletior. in  hΩ  years (Annex 13).  Annual estimated disburseenes
during the W43 years would be:
Year           First   Second   Third   Fourth   Fifth   Total
Amount          140       980    1,870    1,520    590    5,000
(US$0o0s)

Credit and Disbursement
7.11      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$7.2 million of
which the foreign exchange ccmponent ccmprises US$3.3 million.  The proposed
IDA credit of US$5.0 million would cover 70% of the project cost including
the whole of the foreign exchange costs and a portion of the local cost.
The justification for financing part of the local cost is included in the
report entitled "'Prospects for Economic Developments in Tanzania" (AF-58b)
dated August 31, 1967.
7.12      Withdrawals frcam the Credit account would reimburse the direct
f'oreign exchange expenditures of the project subsequent to the date of the
Crediti Agreement. In addition, a percentage of the remaining expenditures
would be reimbursed. This percentage would be adjusted so that withdrawals
from the Credit eould not exceed US$5.0 million or 70% of the actual project
3st, whichever may be the smaller; undisbursed amounts would be available
f.or cancellation. In the event that expenditures should exceed the present
estimated cost of US$7.2 million, such excess would be met by the Tanzanian
Goverrment.
VIII. CONCLUSIANS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      The proposed project would increase the output and substantially
ii"aprove the quality of secondary school graduates, thus alleviating the
ahortage of skilled manpower which has hampered implementation of the
l964-69 Economic Development Plan.
32>;J'  To ansure satisfactory implementation of the project, the Govern-
ment has agreed to set up a Project Unit at the Ministry of Education headed
by a Project Director acceptable to the Association and to employ consultant
architects to design and supervise the school construction.  The Government
will also obtain technical assistance for the development of agricultural,
technical and czmercial subjects, wiL] provide fellowships for training of'
counterpa"rt becrLrical assistance and will retain a sufficient number of
suitabl  exprienced teachers to staff its secondary schools.  In order to
i± prove standards in schools, the Government has also agreed to reinforce
the inspectorate at the ,Iinistry of Education and to expedite development
of' the East African School Certificate examinations.
The proposed project is suitab3Ie as a basis for an IDA credit of
.$ 0' cillion to the Governmenct of' Tanzania. The credit would cover the
fo t.oreign exchange componert of US$3.3 million and the balance of
7  illiion would cover about 41  of the local costs.
