IT1ERNATICNAL DEVELOFMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOPIENDATIONT OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOIEiqTT CREDIT TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZAVIA
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1. *I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed deve'lop-
ment credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $5.0 million to
the United Republic of Tanzania.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.       The first IDA credit to Tanzania in December 1963 was for the expansion
of secondary schools. That project was completed satisfactorily by December
1967 and in November 1967 the Government applied to the Association for a second
education credit. The project was appraised in Nay/June 1968, after the Govern-
ment had supplied additional information, and negotiations were held in Novem-
ber 1968. As negotiated the project consisted of the construction and equipping
of three new secondary schools, extensions to 25 existing schools, extensions
to three teacher training colleges and training of practical subjects, teachers
at Dar es Salaam Teacher Training College. The proposed financing would have
been an IDA credit of $5.0 million supplemented by a Bank loan of $1.7 million.
The Government was reluctant to incur a Bank loan for the project and decided
to explore with bilateral sources the possibility of finance and concessional
terms. The quest was successful: Denmark and Norway have agreed to finance two
of the three new secondary schools, obviating the need for the Bank loan.
3.       The Tanzania delegation to negotiate the credit consisted of Messrs.
I.M. Kaduma, Director of Development Finance, the Treasury; A.C. Mwingira)
Acting Principal Secretary, Ministry of Education; B.N. Makani, Senior State
Attorney; J.J. Kinunda, Senior Education Officer; and E.K. P1Mamafupa, Education
Counselor, Tanzania Embassy, Washington, D.C.
4.       The proposed credit would bring total IDA financing in Tanzania to
$40.9 million. Total Bank financing amounts to $12.2 million. The following
is a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits to Tanzania as at
March 31, 1969:

5.        Progress under the 1964 Roads Crerit (48-TA) has improved during the
last year with a resultant acceleration in disbursements. Disbursements from
the SupDlementary Roads Credit (115-TA) have been held up by delays in recruiting
experts to be financed under the credit for thle staffing and training program
of the Roads and Aerodromas Division of the Ministry of Communications, Labour
and Works. Recruitment of these experts is now in process. Disbursements under
the Power Loan (518-TA) have been slow because suppliers of ecliipment have not
required deposits against orders. Equipment is being delivered in Tanzania as
scheduled and the rate of disbursements is now reflecting the physical progress
on the project.
6.        In addition to the above loans an' credits, the Bank has made three
loans for common services in East Africa. All three loans are guaranteed by
Tanzania jointly and severally with Kenya and Ugarda. The United Kingdom is
also guarantor for the first of these loans. The following is a summary state-
ment of these loans as at March 31, 1969:
Amount (Us $ million)

* As successor to EACSA (East African Common Services Authority)
7.        No other loans or credits to Tanzania are planned for consideration
for the balance of the fiscal year. Negotiations began on April 11, 1969 for
a proposed loan of $35 million for the East African Harbours Corporation
'968-73 investment program. The proposed loan would be guaranteed by Tanzania
jointly and severally with Kenya and Uganda. A loan for the East African
Railways Corporation, for which Tanzania, jointly and severally with Kenya and
Uganda, would also be guarantor is under active consideration.
8.        IFC has made two investments in Kilombero Sugar Company, Ltd. in
1960 and 1964 amournting to $3.7 million in loans and $0.7 million in shares.
On February 25, 1969 the Board of Directors of IFC approved the sale of IFC's
interest on terms specified in the agreement reached between the investors in
the company and the Goverrment on February 3.



9.        Negotiations continue between the Government and the two British
banks and other claimants, under the 1967 Nationalization Act.,
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE FROPOSED CREDIT
10.       BORRGWER:                  The United Republic of Tanzania
AMOUNT:                    US $5.0 million equivalent in various
currencies.
PURPOSE:                   To help finance the construction of one
new secondary school, expansion of 24
secondary schools and of three teacher
training colleges, and construction and
remodeling of staff housing.
AMORTIZATION:              In 50 years including a 10-year period
of grace, through semi-annual installments
of 1/2 of 1% from June 15, 1979 through
December 15, 1988 and of 1-1/2% from
June 15, 1989 through December 15, 2018.
SERVICE CHARGE:            3/4 of 1% per annum.
PART III - THE PROJECT
11.       An appraisal report entitled "Second Education Project - Tanzania"1
(TO 696a dated April 14, 1969) is attached. The proposed project consists of
(i) the construction and equipment of one new secondary school, (ii) extensions
to 24 secondary schools, (iii) extensions to two primary teacher training col-
leges, (iv) extensions to one secondary teacher training college, (v) construc-
tion of 63 staff houses at 14 secondary schools and 2 primary teacher training
colleges, (vi) remodeling of 9 staff houses at 2 secondary schools, and
(vii) consulting services for the above works.
12.       At the time of negotiations the Government of Tanzania agreed to
obtain from bilateral sources the services of 10 specialist teachers in agri-
culture, commercial and technical education with qualifications and experience
satisfactory to the Association. This recruiting is in process.
13.       The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at $7.2 million
based on estimates prepared by the appraisal mission and Government architects.
The detailed engineering and supervision of construction would be carried out
by consultants, and construction contracts and purchases of equipment would be
arranged on the basis of international competitive bidding.
14.       The proposed external financing would cover 70 percent of expenditures
on the project or $5.0 million, whichever would be the lower. The proposed
credit would cover the estimated foreign exchange component of the project
amounting to $3.3 million, as well as $1.7 million of local costs for the
reasons set forth in paragraph 21 below.



PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUCiMENTS AND AUTHORITY
15.       The Draft Development Credit Agreement between the United Republic
of Tanzania and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of
a Resolution approving the proposed Development Credit are being distributed
to the Excecutive Directors separately.
16.       The Draft Development Credit Agreement conforms substantially to the
pattern of agreements used for education projects.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
17.       A memorandum entitled "Recent Developments in the East African
Community, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda (AF-7h) was distributed to the Ececutive
Directors on April 4, 1968 (R 68-52).
18.       An account of the performance of the eccnomy in 1968 was given in
my Report and Recommendation to the Executive Directors on a loan and credit
to Tanzania for a Second Highway project (Report No. P-669 of February 4, 1969).
That account, based on provisional information, showed that the economy may
have grown by about 5 percent in 1968, thus representing a. slight improvement
over the previous year. More recent, although still provisional, information
indicates that agricultural output was lower than originally estimated and also
that minerel output, particularly of diamonds, was lower. In view of this,
the growth rate may have been somewhat below 5 percent.
19.       Tanzania's present Five-year Plan will end on June 30, 1969 and a
new plan will be launched; a Bank economic mission is scheduled to visit
Tanzania in August this year to review the new plan and assess orospects for
the future. It is estimated that, despite the lag in the preparation and
execution of projects in the first 2-3 years of the current Plan, investment
may reach about 85 percent of the targets; in physical terms the achievement
may be 70 to 75 percent of the targets.
20.       In 1968 the longstanding surplus on the merchandise account of
Tanzania's balance of payments turned into a deficit. This was largely due to
a steep rise in imports, particularly of capital goods, without a corresponding
increase in exports. The deficit in the current accuant was offset, to some
extent, by a significant rise in invisible receipts, especially from tourism
and international freight movements arising from Zambian trade. Long-term
capital inflows more than offset the deficit on the current account; convertible
foreign assets of the Bank of Tanzania rose to $85.7 million at the end of
1968 - an increase of about $11.9 million over the amount a year earlier.
21.       It is estimated that domestic resources have financed about 60 percent
of the public sector investment program during the period 196h-68. However,
investment in the early years of the Plan were limited by the slow preparation
and execution of projects. As a result of the improvement in this respect
which has recently been achieved, Tanzania's ability to make good use of



external aid is likely to be substantially increased. With P. higher level
of investment, domestic savings will prove increasingly inadequate, and the
financing of a proportion of the local costs of high priority projects is
justified so long as the Government makes effective efforts to maximize its
own contribution. The proposed credit would cover, in addition to the foreign
exchange cost, about 43 percent of the local expenditure required for the
project.
22.       The servicing of Tanzania's external debt, including its share of
the East African Community debt, absorbed only 4.5 percent of its foreign
exchange earnings in 1967. A tentative estimate of the debt service ratio
for 1968 is about 6 percent. While the burden of debt service is still
relatively lao, the poverty of the country (per capita income of $65 in 1967),
the prospects for slow growth in export earnings, and the probability that
external finance for the Common Services will be provided only on conventional
terms, justifies lending for national projects, as far as possible, on con-
cessionary terms.
PART VI - C0iPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES
23.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECO11ENDATION
24.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.
