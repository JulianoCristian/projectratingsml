The project components will: 1) strengthen\n            the Revenue Authority, and contribute to the reform of tax\n            policy, by improving tax, and customs systems, procedures\n            and training.

Additionally, the Parliament's\n            fiduciary oversight will be strengthened, human resources\n            and payroll databases integrated, and, the privatization\n            process of the Guyana National Cooperative Bank will be\n            supported, as will the monitoring and management of other\n            state owned corporations, and entities; 2) strengthen\n            capacities, and the existing social safety net programs, by\n            improving systems, processes, and training, in addition to\n            recommending labor market regulations, including safety net\n            recommendations on sector restructuring, particularly in the\n            sugar industry; and, 3) develop an institutional capacity to\n            manage, monitor, evaluate, and accomplish the PRSP\n            implementation, through improved processes, systems, and training."}, "docdt": "2002-11-19T00:00:00Z"}
