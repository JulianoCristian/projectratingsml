satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: Continuity of project fiduciary\n            staff has positive outcomes for financial management and\n            procurement aspects of the project. Staff continuity\n            facilitated the disbursement of needed funds and procurement\n            procedures. Having a good local consultant in the Bank\n            office was crucial to working on the ground in Guyana. It\n            was particularly helpful for understanding the domestic\n            culture and politics, and for helping to move the agenda\n            forward. Technical assistance loans (TALs)\n            characteristically produce studies and recommendations,\n            whose implementation are often left uncertain or long\n            delayed by the absence of follow-up resources. In future\n            operations, it might be useful to have provisions for\n            contingent funds for such purposes."}, "docdt": "2008-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
